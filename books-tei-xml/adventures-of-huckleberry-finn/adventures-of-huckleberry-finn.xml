It was an awful sight of money when it was piled up. Well, <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_judge_thatcher">Judge Thatcher</rs> he took it and put it out at interest, and it fetched us a dollar a day apiece all the year round&#x2014;more than <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>a body</orig><reg>somebody</reg></choice></distinct> could tell what to do with. The <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_widow_douglas">Widow Douglas</rs> she took me for her son, and allowed she would sivilize me; but it was rough living in the house all the time, considering how dismal regular and decent the widow was in all her ways; and so when I couldn't stand it no longer I lit out. I got into my old rags and my sugar-hogshead again, and was free and satisfied. But <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom Sawyer</rs>he hunted me up and said he was going to start a band of robbers, and I might join if I would go back to the widow and be respectable. So I went back. </p>

        The widow she cried over me, and called me a poor lost lamb, and she
        called me a lot of other names, too, but she never meant no harm by it.
        She put me in them new clothes again, and I couldn't do nothing but sweat
        and sweat, and feel all cramped up. Well, then, the old thing
        commenced again. The widow rung a bell for supper, and you had to
        come to time. When you got to the table you couldn't go right to eating,
        but you had to wait for the widow to tuck down her head and grumble a
        little over the victuals, though there warn't really anything the matter
        with them,&#x2014;that is, nothing only everything was cooked by itself.
        In a barrel of odds and ends it is different; things get mixed up,
        and the juice kind of swaps around, and the things go better.

        After supper she got out her book and learned me about Moses and the
        Bulrushers, and I was in a sweat to find out all about him; but by and by
        she let it out that Moses had been dead a considerable long time; so then
        I didn't care no more about him, because I don't take no stock in dead
        people.

        Pretty soon I wanted to smoke, and asked the widow to let me. But
        she wouldn't. She said it was a mean practice and wasn't clean, and
        I must try to not do it any more. That is just the way with some
        people. They get down on a thing when they don't know nothing about
        it. Here she was a-bothering about Moses, which was no kin to her,
        and no use to anybody, being gone, you see, yet finding a power of fault
        with me for doing a thing that had some good in it. And she took
        snuff, too; of course that was all right, because she done it herself.

        Her sister, Miss Watson, a tolerable slim old maid, with goggles on, had
        just come to live with her, and took a set at me now with a spelling-book.
        She worked me middling hard for about an hour, and then the widow made her
        ease up. I couldn't stood it much longer. Then for an hour it
        was deadly dull, and I was fidgety. <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_miss_watson">Miss Watson</rs> would say, <said who="#c_miss_watson">"Don't

        gap and stretch like that, Huckleberry&#x2014;why don't you try to behave?"</said>
        Then she told me all about the bad place, and I said I wished I was
        there. She got mad then, but I didn't mean no harm. All I wanted was
        to go somewheres; all I wanted was a change, I warn't particular. She
        said it was wicked to say what I said; said she wouldn't say it for the
        whole world; she was going to live so as to go to the good place. Well,
        I couldn't see no advantage in going where she was going, so I made up my
        mind I wouldn't try for it. But I never said so, because it would
        only make trouble, and wouldn't do no good.

        Now she had got a start, and she went on and told me all about the good
        place. She said all <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>a body</orig><reg>somebody</reg></choice></distinct> would have to do there was to go around
        all day long with a harp and sing, forever and ever. So I didn't
        think much of it. But I never said so. I asked her if she <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckoned</orig><reg>thought</reg></choice></distinct>
        <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom Sawyer</rs>would go there, and she said not by a considerable sight.

        <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_miss_watson">Miss Watson</rs> she kept pecking at me, and it got tiresome and lonesome.
        By and by they fetched the niggers in and had prayers, and then
        everybody was off to bed. I went up to my room with a piece of
        candle, and put it on the table. Then I set down in a chair by the
        window and tried to think of something cheerful, but it warn't no use.
        I felt so lonesome I most wished I was dead. The stars were
        shining, and the leaves rustled in the woods ever so mournful; and I heard
        an owl, away off, who-whooing about somebody that was dead, and a
        whippowill and a dog crying about somebody that was going to die; and the
        wind was trying to whisper something to me, and I couldn't make out what
        it was, and so it made the cold shivers run over me. Then away out in the
        woods I heard that kind of a sound that a ghost makes when it wants to
        tell about something that's on its mind and can't make itself understood,
        and so can't rest easy in its grave, and has to go about that way every
        night grieving. I got so down-hearted and scared I did wish I had
        some company. Pretty soon a spider went crawling up my shoulder, and
        I flipped it off and it lit in the candle; and before I could budge it was
        all shriveled up. I didn't need anybody to tell me that that was an
        awful bad sign and would fetch me some bad luck, so I was scared and most
        shook the clothes off of me. I got up and turned around in my tracks three
        times and crossed my breast every time; and then I tied up a little lock
        of my hair with a thread to keep witches away. But I hadn't no
        confidence. You do that when you've lost a horseshoe that you've
        found, instead of nailing it up over the door, but I hadn't ever heard
        anybody say it was any way to keep off bad luck when you'd killed a
        spider.

        I set down again, a-shaking all over, and got out my pipe for a smoke; for
        the house was all as still as death now, and so the widow wouldn't know.
        Well, after a long time I heard the clock away off in the town go boom&#x2014;boom&#x2014;boom&#x2014;twelve
        licks; and all still again&#x2014;stiller than ever. Pretty soon I heard a
        twig snap down in the dark amongst the trees&#x2014;something was a
        stirring. I set still and listened. Directly I could just
        barely hear a "me-yow! me-yow!" down there. That was good! Says
        I, "me-yow! me-yow!" as soft as I could, and then I put out the light and
        scrambled out of the window on to the shed. Then I slipped down to
        the ground and crawled in among the trees, and, sure enough, there was Tom
        Sawyer waiting for me.

      WE went tiptoeing along a path amongst the trees back towards the end of
      the widow's garden, stooping down so as the branches wouldn't scrape our
      heads. When we was passing by the kitchen I fell over a root and made a
      noise. We scrouched down and laid still. Miss Watson's big
      nigger, named Jim, was setting in the kitchen door; we could see him
      pretty clear, because there was a light behind him. He got up and
      stretched his neck out about a minute, listening. Then he says:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="C1784361-F78F-4E48-8771-D25DEFCB9C97">
      "Who dah?"

    <p xml:id="B574EFFC-8390-4C06-9A1A-BFD68E1366B9">
      He listened some more; then he come tiptoeing down and stood right between
      us; we could a touched him, nearly. Well, likely it was minutes and
      minutes that there warn't a sound, and we all there so close together.
      There was a place on my ankle thatgot got to itching, but I dasn't
      scratch it; and then my ear begun to itch; and next my back, right between
      my shoulders. Seemed like I'd die if I couldn't scratch. Well,
      I've noticed that thing plenty times since. If you are with the
      quality, or at a funeral, or trying to go to sleep when you ain't sleepy&#x2014;if
      you are anywheres where it won't do for you to scratch, why you will itch
      all over in upwards of a thousand places. Pretty soon <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> says:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="63A9FD5A-2340-4BE3-8A13-D396BFE7C2A2">
      "Say, who is you? Whar is you? Dog my cats ef I didn' hear

      So he set down on the ground betwixt me and Tom. He leaned his back
      up against a tree, and stretched his legs out till one of them most
      touched one of mine. My nose begun to itch. It itched till the
      tears come into my eyes. But I dasn't scratch. Then it begun
      to itch on the inside. Next I got to itching underneath. I didn't
      know how I was going to set still. This miserableness went on as much as
      six or seven minutes; but it seemed a sight longer than that. I was
      itching in eleven different places now. I <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckoned</orig><reg>thought</reg></choice></distinct> I couldn't stand
      it more'n a minute longer, but I set my teeth hard and got ready to try.
      Just then <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> begun to breathe heavy; next he begun to snore&#x2014;and
      then I was pretty soon comfortable again.

      <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom</rs> e made a sign to me&#x2014;kind of a little noise with his mouth&#x2014;and
      we went creeping away on our hands and knees. When we was ten foot
      off Tom whispered to me, and wanted to tie <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> to the tree for fun. But
      I said no; he might wake and make a disturbance, and then they'd find out
      I warn't in. Then <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom</rs> aid he hadn't got candles enough, and he would slip
      in the kitchen and get some more. I didn't want him to try. I
      said <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> might wake up and come. But Tom wanted to resk it; so we
      slid in there and got three candles, and <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom</rs> aid five cents on the table
      for pay. Then we got out, and I was in a sweat to get away; but nothing
      would do <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom</rs> ut he must crawl to where <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> was, on his hands and knees,
      and play something on him. I waited, and it seemed a good while,
      everything was so still and lonesome.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="C4BFC0B1-BD7F-4038-82AA-682F902B7975">
      As soon as Tom was back we cut along the path, around the garden fence,
      and by and by fetched up on the steep top of the hill the other side of
      the house. <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom</rs> aid he slipped Jim's hat off of his head and hung it
      on a limb right over him, and <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> stirred a little, but he didn't wake.
      Afterwards <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> said the witches be witched him and put him in a trance,
      and rode him all over the State, and then set him under the trees again,
      and hung his hat on a limb to show who done it. And next time Jim
      told it he said they rode him down to New Orleans; and, after that, every
      time he told it he spread it more and more, till by and by he said they
      rode him all over the world, and tired him most to death, and his back was
      all over saddle-boils. <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> was monstrous proud about it, and he got
      so he wouldn't hardly notice the other niggers. Niggers would come
      miles to hear <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> tell about it, and he was more looked up to than any
      nigger in that country. Strange niggers would stand with their
      mouths open and look him all over, same as if he was a wonder. Niggers
      is always talking about witches in the dark by the kitchen fire; but
      whenever one was talking and letting on to know all about such things, Jim
      would happen in and say, "Hm! What you know 'bout witches?" and that
      nigger was corked up and had to take a back seat. <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> always kept
      that five-center piece round his neck with a string, and said it was a
      charm the devil give to him with his own hands, and told him he could cure
      anybody with it and fetch witches whenever he wanted to just by saying
      something to it; but he never told what it was he said to it. Niggers
      would come from all around there and give <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> anything they had, just for
      a sight of that five-center piece; but they wouldn't touch it, because the
      devil had had his hands on it. <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> was most ruined for a servant,
      because he got stuck up on account of having seen the devil and been rode
      by witches.

      Well, when Tom and me got to the edge of the hilltop we looked away down
      into the village and could see three or four lights twinkling, where there
      was sick folks, maybe; and the stars over us was sparkling ever so fine;
      and down by the village was the river, a whole mile broad, and awful still
      and grand. We went down the hill and found Jo Harper and Ben Rogers,
      and two or three more of the boys, hid in the old tanyard. So we
      unhitched a skiff and pulled down the river two mile and a half, to the
      big scar on the hillside, and went ashore.

    <p xml:id="4AC96DE9-4CD6-4E9E-9DD2-5873ABD0E8C4">
      We went to a clump of bushes, and <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom</rs> ade everybody swear to keep the
      secret, and then showed them a hole in the hill, right in the thickest
      part of the bushes. Then we lit the candles, and crawled in on our
      hands and knees. We went about two hundred yards, and then the cave
      opened up. <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom</rs> oked about amongst the passages, and pretty soon ducked
      under a wall where you wouldn't a noticed that there was a hole. We

      and cold, and there we stopped. <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom</rs> ays:

      wrote the oath on, and read it. It swore every boy to stick to the

      any boy in the band, whichever boy was ordered to kill that person and his
      family must do it, and he mustn't eat and he mustn't sleep till he had
      killed them and hacked a cross in their breasts, which was the sign of the
      band. And nobody that didn't belong to the band could use that mark, and
      if he did he must be sued; and if he done it again he must be killed.
      And if anybody that belonged to the band told the secrets, he must
      have his throat cut, and then have his carcass burnt up and the ashes
      scattered all around, and his name blotted off of the list with blood and
      never mentioned again by the gang, but have a curse put on it and be

        by praying for it was "spiritual gifts." This was too many for me,
        but she told me what she meant&#x2014;I must help other people, and do
        everything I could for other people, and look out for them all the time,
        and never think about myself. This was including Miss Watson, as I took
        it. I went out in the woods and turned it over in my mind a long
        time, but I couldn't see no advantage about it&#x2014;except for the other
        people; so at last I <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckoned</orig><reg>thought</reg></choice></distinct> I wouldn't worry about it any more, but just
        let it go. Sometimes the widow would take me one side and talk about

        had been in the water so long it warn't much like a face at all. They
        said he was floating on his back in the water. They took him and

        We played robber now and then about a month, and then I resigned. All
        the boys did. We hadn't robbed nobody, hadn't killed any people, but
        only just pretended. We used to hop out of the woods and go charging
        down on hog-drivers and women in carts taking garden stuff to market, but

        a boy to run about town with a blazing stick, which he called a slogan
        (which was the sign for the Gang to get together), and then he said he had
        got secret news by his spies that next day a whole parcel of Spanish
        merchants and rich A-rabs was going to camp in Cave Hollow with two
        hundred elephants, and six hundred camels, and over a thousand "sumter"
        mules, all loaded down with di'monds, and they didn't have only a guard of
        four hundred soldiers, and so we would lay in ambuscade, as he called it,
        and kill the lot and scoop the things. He said we must slick up our
        swords and guns, and get ready. He never could go after even a
        turnip-cart but he must have the swords and guns all scoured up for it,
        though they was only lath and broomsticks, and you might scour at them
        till you rotted, and then they warn't worth a mouthful of ashes more than
        what they was before. I didn't believe we could lick such a crowd of
        Spaniards and A-rabs, but I wanted to see the camels and elephants, so I
        was on hand next day, Saturday, in the ambuscade; and when we got the word
        we rushed out of the woods and down the hill. But there warn't no
        Spaniards and A-rabs, and there warn't no camels nor no elephants. It
        warn't anything but a Sunday-school picnic, and only a primer-class at
        that. We busted it up, and chased the children up the hollow; but we
        never got anything but some doughnuts and jam, though Ben Rogers got a rag
        doll, and Jo Harper got a hymn-book and a tract; and then the teacher
        charged in, and made us drop everything and cut.

        Whenever I got uncommon tired I played hookey, and the hiding I got next
        day done me good and cheered me up. So the longer I went to school
        the easier it got to be. I was getting sort of used to the widow's
        ways, too, and they warn't so raspy on me. Living in a house and
        sleeping in a bed pulled on me pretty tight mostly, but before the cold
        weather I used to slide out and sleep in the woods sometimes, and so that
        was a rest to me. I liked the old ways best, but I was getting so I
        liked the new ones, too, a little bit. The widow said I was coming along
        slow but sure, and doing very satisfactory. She said she warn't
        ashamed of me.

        going to keep off the bad luck, I knowed that well enough. I started
        out, after breakfast, feeling worried and shaky, and wondering where it
        was going to fall on me, and what it was going to be. There is ways

        around so. I couldn't make it out. It was very curious,

        through the silver a little, and it wouldn't pass nohow, even if the brass
        didn't show, because it was so slick it felt greasy, and so that would

        dollar I got from the judge.) I said it was pretty bad money, but maybe

        difference. <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> smelt it and bit it and rubbed it, and said he would
        manage so the hair-ball would think it was good. He said he would

        there all night, and next morning you couldn't see no brass, and it
        wouldn't feel greasy no more, and so anybody in town would take it in a

        and we fished and hunted, and that was what we lived on. Every

        dreadful lonesome. I judged he had got drownded, and I wasn't ever
        going to get out any more. I was scared. I made up my mind I
        would fix up some way to leave there. I had tried to get out of that
        cabin many a time, but I couldn't find no way. There warn't a window
        to it big enough for a dog to get through. I couldn't get up the

        last; I found an old rusty wood-saw without any handle; it was laid in
        between a rafter and the clapboards of the roof. I greased it up and went
        to work. There was an old horse-blanket nailed against the logs at
        the far end of the cabin behind the table, to keep the wind from blowing
        through the chinks and putting the candle out. I got under the table
        and raised the blanket, and went to work to saw a section of the big
        bottom log out&#x2014;big enough to let me through. Well, it was a
        good long job, but I was getting towards the end of it when I heard pap's
        gun in the woods. I got rid of the signs of my work, and dropped the

        be so cramped up and sivilized, as they called it. Then the old man
        got to cussing, and cussed everything and everybody he could think of, and
        then cussed them all over again to make sure he hadn't skipped any, and
        after that he polished off with a kind of a general cuss all round,
        including a considerable parcel of people which he didn't know the names
        of, and so called them what's-his-name when he got to them, and went right
        along with his cussing.

        He said he would like to see the widow get me. He said he would
        watch out, and if they tried to come any such game on him he knowed of a
        place six or seven mile off to stow me in, where they might hunt till they
        dropped and they couldn't find me. That made me pretty uneasy again,
        but only for a minute; I <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckoned</orig><reg>thought</reg></choice></distinct> I wouldn't stay on hand till he got that

        The old man made me go to the skiff and fetch the things he had got. There
        was a fifty-pound sack of corn meal, and a side of bacon, ammunition, and
        a four-gallon jug of whisky, and an old book and two newspapers for
        wadding, besides some tow. I toted up a load, and went back and set
        down on the bow of the skiff to rest. I thought it all over, and I
        <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckoned</orig><reg>thought</reg></choice></distinct> I would walk off with the gun and some lines, and take to the
        woods when I run away. I guessed I wouldn't stay in one place, but
        just tramp right across the country, mostly night times, and hunt and fish
        to keep alive, and so get so far away that the old man nor the widow
        couldn't ever find me any more. I judged I would saw out and leave
        that night if pap got drunk enough, and I <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckoned</orig><reg>thought</reg></choice></distinct> he would. I got
        so full of it I didn't notice how long I was staying till the old man

        There was a free nigger there from Ohio&#x2014;a mulatter, most as white as

        shiniest hat; and there ain't a man in that town that's got as fine
        clothes as what he had; and he had a gold watch and chain, and a
        silver-headed cane&#x2014;the awfulest old gray-headed nabob in the State.
        And what do you think? They said he was a p'fessor in a
        college, and could talk all kinds of languages, and knowed everything.
        And that ain't the wust. They said he could <hi rend="italics">vote</hi> when he was at
        home. Well, that let me out. Thinks I, what is the country a-coming
        to? It was 'lection day, and I was just about to go and vote myself
        if I warn't too drunk to get there; but when they told me there was a
        State in this country where they'd let that nigger vote, I drawed out.
        I says I'll never vote agin. <distinct type="l_huck"><choice><orig>them</orig><reg>those</reg></choice></distinct>'s the very words I said;

        he wouldn't a give me the road if I hadn't shoved him out o' the way.

        a specimen. They call that a govment that can't sell a free nigger

        language&#x2014;mostly hove at the nigger and the govment, though he give
        the tub some, too, all along, here and there. He hopped around the

        one shin and then the other one, and at last he let out with his left foot
        all of a sudden and fetched the tub a rattling kick. But it warn't
        good judgment, because that was the boot that had a couple of his toes
        leaking out of the front end of it; so now he raised a howl that fairly
        made <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>a body</orig><reg>somebody</reg></choice></distinct>'s hair raise, and down he went in the dirt, and rolled there,
        and held his toes; and the cussing he done then laid over anything he had

        heard old Sowberry Hagan in his best days, and he said it laid over him,

        After supper pap took the jug, and said he had enough whisky there for two
        drunks and one delirium tremens. That was always his word. I
        judged he would be blind drunk in about an hour, and then I would steal
        the key, or saw myself out, one or t'other. He drank and drank, and
        tumbled down on his blankets by and by; but luck didn't run my way. He
        didn't go sound asleep, but was uneasy. He groaned and moaned and
        thrashed around this way and that for a long time. At last I got so
        sleepy I couldn't keep my eyes open all I could do, and so before I knowed
        what I was about I was sound asleep, and the candle burning.

        I don't know how long I was asleep, but all of a sudden there was an awful
        scream and I was up. There was pap looking wild, and skipping around
        every which way and yelling about snakes. He said they was crawling
        up his legs; and then he would give a jump and scream, and say one had bit
        him on the cheek&#x2014;but I couldn't see no snakes. He started and
        run round and round the cabin, hollering "Take him off! take him off! he's
        biting me on the neck!" I never see a man look so wild in the eyes.
        Pretty soon he was all fagged out, and fell down panting; then he rolled
        over and over wonderful fast, kicking things every which way, and striking
        and grabbing at the air with his hands, and screaming and saying there was
        devils a-hold of him. He wore out by and by, and laid still a while,
        moaning. Then he laid stiller, and didn't make a sound. I
        could hear the owls and the wolves away off in the woods, and it seemed
        terrible still. He was laying over by the corner. By and by he
        raised up part way and listened, with his head to one side. He says,
        very low:
      </p>
      <p xml:id="01784277-EBF0-4A8E-92E8-34BD5D14AA1A">

      <p xml:id="57A34BC1-CF16-4372-9D05-BD2A956702CB">
        Then he went down on all fours and crawled off, begging them to let him
        alone, and he rolled himself up in his blanket and wallowed in under the
        old pine table, still a-begging; and then he went to crying. I could
        hear him through the blanket.
      </p>
      <p xml:id="6B8C9C3C-52DA-4F09-9807-74A1D1607303">
        By and by he rolled out and jumped up on his feet looking wild, and he see
        me and went for me. He chased me round and round the place with a
        clasp-knife, calling me the Angel of Death, and saying he would kill me,
        and then I couldn't come for him no more. I begged, and told him I
        was only Huck; but he laughed <hi rend="italics">such</hi> a screechy laugh, and roared and
        cussed, and kept on chasing me up. Once when I turned short and
        dodged under his arm he made a grab and got me by the jacket between my
        shoulders, and I thought I was gone; but I slid out of the jacket quick as
        lightning, and saved myself. Pretty soon he was all tired out, and dropped
        down with his back against the door, and said he would rest a minute and
        then kill me. He put his knife under him, and said he would sleep and get
        strong, and then he would see who was who.

        So he dozed off pretty soon. By and by I got the old split-bottom
        chair and clumb up as easy as I could, not to make any noise, and got down
        the gun. I slipped the ramrod down it to make sure it was loaded,
        then I laid it across the turnip barrel, pointing towards pap, and set
        down behind it to wait for him to stir. And how slow and still the
        time did drag along.

      THE sun was up so high when I waked that I judged it was after eight
      o'clock. I laid there in the grass and the cool shade thinking about
      things, and feeling rested and ruther comfortable and satisfied. I
      could see the sun out at one or two holes, but mostly it was big trees all
      about, and gloomy in there amongst them. There was freckled places
      on the ground where the light sifted down through the leaves, and the
      freckled places swapped about a little, showing there was a little breeze
      up there. A couple of squirrels set on a limb and jabbered at me
      very friendly.

    <p xml:id="8559ADB4-570D-4F2B-8A2E-7DA0ED4C9A59">
      I was powerful lazy and comfortable&#x2014;didn't want to get up and cook
      breakfast. Well, I was dozing off again when I thinks I hears a deep
      sound of "boom!" away up the river. I rouses up, and rests on my
      elbow and listens; pretty soon I hears it again. I hopped up, and
      went and looked out at a hole in the leaves, and I see a bunch of smoke
      laying on the water a long ways up&#x2014;about abreast the ferry. And
      there was the ferryboat full of people floating along down. I knowed
      what was the matter now. "Boom!" I see the white smoke squirt out of
      the ferryboat's side. You see, they was firing cannon over the
      water, trying to make my carcass come to the top.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="AFD754CB-E6CE-4CCE-BE43-12AD6B850BF4">
      I was pretty hungry, but it warn't going to do for me to start a fire,
      because they might see the smoke. So I set there and watched the
      cannon-smoke and listened to the boom. The river was a mile wide
      there, and it always looks pretty on a summer morning&#x2014;so I was
      having a good enough time seeing them hunt for my remainders if I only had
      a bite to eat. Well, then I happened to think how they always put
      quicksilver in loaves of bread and float them off, because they always go
      right to the drownded carcass and stop there. So, says I, I'll keep
      a lookout, and if any of <distinct type="l_huck"><choice><orig>them</orig><reg>those</reg></choice></distinct>'s floating around after me I'll give them a
      show. I changed to the Illinois edge of the island to see what luck
      I could have, and I warn't disappointed. A big double loaf come
      along, and I most got it with a long stick, but my foot slipped and she
      floated out further. Of course I was where the current set in the
      closest to the shore&#x2014;I knowed enough for that. But by and by
      along comes another one, and this time I won. I took out the plug
      and shook out the little dab of quicksilver, and set my teeth in. It
      was "baker's bread"&#x2014;what the quality eat; none of your low-down
      corn-pone.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="930A981D-58C6-4136-A360-AD06BED04310">
      I got a good place amongst the leaves, and set there on a log, munching
      the bread and watching the ferry-boat, and very well satisfied. And
      then something struck me. I says, now I <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckon</orig><reg>think</reg></choice></distinct> the widow or the
      parson or somebody prayed that this bread would find me, and here it has
      gone and done it. So there ain't no doubt but there is something in
      that thing&#x2014;that is, there's something in it when <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>a body</orig><reg>somebody</reg></choice></distinct> like the

      I lit a pipe and had a good long smoke, and went on watching. The
      ferryboat was floating with the current, and I allowed I'd have a chance
      to see who was aboard when she come along, because she would come in
      close, where the bread did. When she'd got pretty well along down
      towards me, I put out my pipe and went to where I fished out the bread,
      and laid down behind a log on the bank in a little open place. Where
      the log forked I could peep through.

      nearly in my face, and kept still, watching with all their might. I
      could see them first-rate, but they couldn't see me. Then the
      captain sung out:

    <p xml:id="073EF730-63E1-4882-8402-8FC53C31E146">
      "Stand away!" and the cannon let off such a blast right before me that it
      made me deef with the noise and pretty near blind with the smoke, and I
      judged I was gone. If they'd a had some bullets in, I <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckon</orig><reg>think</reg></choice></distinct> they'd
      a got the corpse they was after. Well, I see I warn't hurt, thanks
      to goodness. The boat floated on and went out of sight around the shoulder
      of the island. I could hear the booming now and then, further and
      further off, and by and by, after an hour, I didn't hear it no more.
      The island was three mile long. I judged they had got to the
      foot, and was giving it up. But they didn't yet a while. They
      turned around the foot of the island and started up the channel on the
      Missouri side, under steam, and booming once in a while as they went.
      I crossed over to that side and watched them. When they got abreast
      the head of the island they quit shooting and dropped over to the Missouri
      shore and went home to the town.

      I knowed I was all right now. Nobody else would come a-hunting after
      me. I got my traps out of the canoe and made me a nice camp in the thick
      woods. I made a kind of a tent out of my blankets to put my things
      under so the rain couldn't get at them. I catched a catfish and
      haggled him open with my saw, and towards sundown I started my camp fire
      and had supper. Then I set out a line to catch some fish for
      breakfast.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="48A2B7E5-BB40-4CC3-957E-3CADAAA5329B">
      When it was dark I set by my camp fire smoking, and feeling pretty well
      satisfied; but by and by it got sort of lonesome, and so I went and set on
      the bank and listened to the current swashing along, and counted the stars
      and drift logs and rafts that come down, and then went to bed; there ain't
      no better way to put in time when you are lonesome; you can't stay so, you
      soon get over it.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="46C20BC0-D86F-4296-B38E-3F6C044DAA10">
      And so for three days and nights. No difference&#x2014;just the same
      thing. But the next day I went exploring around down through the island.
      I was boss of it; it all belonged to me, so to say, and I wanted to
      know all about it; but mainly I wanted to put in the time. I found
      plenty strawberries, ripe and prime; and green summer grapes, and green
      razberries; and the green blackberries was just beginning to show. They
      would all come handy by and by, I judged.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="67689587-60DC-4F5B-8781-73B812FEEDA0">
      Well, I went fooling along in the deep woods till I judged I warn't far
      from the foot of the island. I had my gun along, but I hadn't shot
      nothing; it was for protection; thought I would kill some game nigh home.
      About this time I mighty near stepped on a good-sized snake, and it went
      sliding off through the grass and flowers, and I after it, trying to get a
      shot at it. I clipped along, and all of a sudden I bounded right on to the
      ashes of a camp fire that was still smoking.

      My heart jumped up amongst my lungs. I never waited for to look
      further, but uncocked my gun and went sneaking back on my tiptoes as fast
      as ever I could. Every now and then I stopped a second amongst the
      thick leaves and listened, but my breath come so hard I couldn't hear
      nothing else. I slunk along another piece further, then listened
      again; and so on, and so on. If I see a stump, I took it for a man;
      if I trod on a stick and broke it, it made me feel like a person had cut
      one of my breaths in two and I only got half, and the short half, too.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="53DCEFC0-7F04-4203-A8A3-315014D75460">
      When I got to camp I warn't feeling very brash, there warn't much sand in
      my craw; but I says, this ain't no time to be fooling around. So I
      got all my traps into my canoe again so as to have them out of sight, and
      I put out the fire and scattered the ashes around to look like an old last
      year's camp, and then clumb a tree.

      I <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckon</orig><reg>think</reg></choice></distinct> I was up in the tree two hours; but I didn't see nothing, I

      thousand things. Well, I couldn't stay up there forever; so at last
      I got down, but I kept in the thick woods and on the lookout all the time.
      All I could get to eat was berries and what was left over from breakfast.

    <p xml:id="FA66CE8B-7E4F-476A-8A07-F88ED646F4FF">
      By the time it was night I was pretty hungry. So when it was good
      and dark I slid out from shore before moonrise and paddled over to the
      Illinois bank&#x2014;about a quarter of a mile. I went out in the
      woods and cooked a supper, and I had about made up my mind I would stay
      there all night when I hear a <hi rend="italics">plunkety-plunk, plunkety-plunk</hi>, and says to
      myself, horses coming; and next I hear people's voices. I got
      everything into the canoe as quick as I could, and then went creeping
      through the woods to see what I could find out. I hadn't got far
      when I hear a man say:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="8AEDB152-249D-4B7B-8BC7-ED8881B856EB">
      "We better camp here if we can find a good place; the horses is about beat
      out. Let's look around."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="71038A84-DD15-4F79-8159-83A69F0610B6">
      I didn't wait, but shoved out and paddled away easy. I tied up in
      the old place, and <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckoned</orig><reg>thought</reg></choice></distinct> I would sleep in the canoe.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="979C7FC0-4900-4C7A-95B9-61829AFCB81C">
      I didn't sleep much. I couldn't, somehow, for thinking. And
      every time I waked up I thought somebody had me by the neck. So the
      sleep didn't do me no good. By and by I says to myself, I can't live
      this way; I'm a-going to find out who it is that's here on the island with
      me; I'll find it out or bust. Well, I felt better right off.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="97047E5A-EFC2-48A9-8F24-2587A77BDA58">
      So I took my paddle and slid out from shore just a step or two, and then
      let the canoe drop along down amongst the shadows. The moon was
      shining, and outside of the shadows it made it most as light as day.
      I poked along well on to an hour, everything still as rocks and
      sound asleep. Well, by this time I was most down to the foot of the
      island. A little ripply, cool breeze begun to blow, and that was as
      good as saying the night was about done. I give her a turn with the
      paddle and brung her nose to shore; then I got my gun and slipped out and
      into the edge of the woods. I sat down there on a log, and looked
      out through the leaves. I see the moon go off watch, and the
      darkness begin to blanket the river. But in a little while I see a pale
      streak over the treetops, and knowed the day was coming. So I took
      my gun and slipped off towards where I had run across that camp fire,
      stopping every minute or two to listen. But I hadn't no luck
      somehow; I couldn't seem to find the place. But by and by, sure
      enough, I catched a glimpse of fire away through the trees. I went
      for it, cautious and slow. By and by I was close enough to have a
      look, and there laid a man on the ground. It most give me the
      fan-tods. He had a blanket around his head, and his head was nearly in the
      fire. I set there behind a clump of bushes, in about six foot of
      him, and kept my eyes on him steady. It was getting gray daylight
      now. Pretty soon he gapped and stretched himself and hove off the
      blanket, and it was Miss Watson's Jim! I bet I was glad to see him.
      I says:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="24554B5B-1546-41A2-9C9A-52CC4E6CDA89">
      "Hello, Jim!" and skipped out.

    <p xml:id="9C1256FE-E623-4885-8EE0-DD86926219B8">
      He bounced up and stared at me wild. Then he drops down on his
      knees, and puts his hands together and says:

      that man died, the bees must be told about it before sun-up next morning,
      or else the bees would all weaken down and quit work and die. Jim

        I wanted to go and look at a place right about the middle of the island
        that I'd found when I was exploring; so we started and soon got to it,
        because the island was only three miles long and a quarter of a mile wide.
      </p>
      <p xml:id="E2C535D5-5178-432C-9E3F-793BFC94F1C8">
        This place was a tolerable long, steep hill or ridge about forty foot
        high. We had a rough time getting to the top, the sides was so steep and
        the bushes so thick. We tramped and clumb around all over it, and by
        and by found a good big cavern in the rock, most up to the top on the side
        towards Illinois. The cavern was as big as two or three rooms
        bunched together, and <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> could stand up straight in it. It was cool
        in there. <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> was for putting our traps in there right away, but I said we
        didn't want to be climbing up and down there all the time.
      </p>
      <p xml:id="53880856-E6B2-4CB4-A6BC-05551F2ACFC0">
        <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> said if we had the canoe hid in a good place, and had all the traps in
        the cavern, we could rush there if anybody was to come to the island, and
        they would never find us without dogs. And, besides, he said them
        little birds had said it was going to rain, and did I want the things to
        get wet?
      </p>
      <p xml:id="222C31A6-8D76-4D05-863F-717E9479D60A">
        So we went back and got the canoe, and paddled up abreast the cavern, and
        lugged all the traps up there. Then we hunted up a place close by to
        hide the canoe in, amongst the thick willows. We took some fish off
        of the lines and set them again, and begun to get ready for dinner.
      </p>
      <p xml:id="CA0F0409-6BE9-4C98-B920-D18FAA01E260">
        The door of the cavern was big enough to roll a hogshead in, and on one
        side of the door the floor stuck out a little bit, and was flat and a good
        place to build a fire on. So we built it there and cooked dinner.

        We spread the blankets inside for a carpet, and eat our dinner in there.
        We put all the other things handy at the back of the cavern. Pretty
        soon it darkened up, and begun to thunder and lighten; so the birds was
        right about it. Directly it begun to rain, and it rained like all
        fury, too, and I never see the wind blow so. It was one of these
        regular summer storms. It would get so dark that it looked all
        blue-black outside, and lovely; and the rain would thrash along by so
        thick that the trees off a little ways looked dim and spider-webby; and
        here would come a blast of wind that would bend the trees down and turn up
        the pale underside of the leaves; and then a perfect ripper of a gust
        would follow along and set the branches to tossing their arms as if they
        was just wild; and next, when it was just about the bluest
        and blackest&#x2014;<hi rend="italics">FST</hi>!
        it was as bright as glory, and you'd have a little glimpse of tree-tops
        a-plunging about away off yonder in the storm, hundreds of yards further
        than you could see before; dark as sin again in a second, and now you'd
        hear the thunder let go with an awful crash, and then go rumbling,
        grumbling, tumbling, down the sky towards the under side of the world,
        like rolling empty barrels down stairs&#x2014;where it's long stairs and
        they bounce a good deal, you know.

        The river went on raising and raising for ten or twelve days, till at last
        it was over the banks. The water was three or four foot deep on the
        island in the low places and on the Illinois bottom. On that side it
        was a good many miles wide, but on the Missouri side it was the same old
        distance across&#x2014;a half a mile&#x2014;because the Missouri shore was
        just a wall of high bluffs.
      </p>
      <p xml:id="2933557E-BBEF-4794-BCD5-5631BCF565FF">
        Daytimes we paddled all over the island in the canoe, It was mighty cool
        and shady in the deep woods, even if the sun was blazing outside. We
        went winding in and out amongst the trees, and sometimes the vines hung so
        thick we had to back away and go some other way. Well, on every old
        broken-down tree you could see rabbits and snakes and such things; and
        when the island had been overflowed a day or two they got so tame, on
        account of being hungry, that you could paddle right up and put your hand
        on them if you wanted to; but not the snakes and turtles&#x2014;they would
        slide off in the water. The ridge our cavern was in was full of
        them. We could a had pets enough if we'd wanted them.

      <p xml:id="C72AEA16-A640-44DF-AA13-DC058731D721">
        One night we catched a little section of a lumber raft&#x2014;nice pine
        planks. It was twelve foot wide and about fifteen or sixteen foot long,
        and the top stood above water six or seven inches&#x2014;a solid, level
        floor. We could see saw-logs go by in the daylight sometimes, but we
        let them go; we didn't show ourselves in daylight.
      </p>
      <p xml:id="FC3FB620-8B43-46D7-B6BF-E8FC67CD442A">
        Another night when we was up at the head of the island, just before
        daylight, here comes a frame-house down, on the west side. She was a
        two-story, and tilted over considerable. We paddled out and got
        aboard&#x2014;clumb in at an upstairs window. But it was too dark to
        see yet, so we made the canoe fast and set in her to wait for daylight.
      </p>
      <p xml:id="F255F7EB-5F75-4C68-B10D-FFC832FE829B">
        The light begun to come before we got to the foot of the island. Then
        we looked in at the window. We could make out a bed, and a table,
        and two old chairs, and lots of things around about on the floor, and
        there was clothes hanging against the wall. There was something
        laying on the floor in the far corner that looked like a man. So Jim
        says:

        I didn't look at him at all. <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> throwed some old rags over him, but
        he needn't done it; I didn't want to see him. There was heaps of old
        greasy cards scattered around over the floor, and old whisky bottles, and
        a couple of masks made out of black cloth; and all over the walls was the
        ignorantest kind of words and pictures made with charcoal. There was
        two old dirty calico dresses, and a sun-bonnet, and some women's
        underclothes hanging against the wall, and some men's clothing, too.
        We put the lot into the canoe&#x2014;it might come good. There
        was a boy's old speckled straw hat on the floor; I took that, too. And
        there was a bottle that had had milk in it, and it had a rag stopper for a
        baby to suck. We would a took the bottle, but it was broke. There
        was a seedy old chest, and an old hair trunk with the hinges broke. They
        stood open, but there warn't nothing left in them that was any account.
        The way things was scattered about we <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckoned</orig><reg>thought</reg></choice></distinct> the people left in a

        We got an old tin lantern, and a butcher-knife without any handle, and a
        bran-new Barlow knife worth two bits in any store, and a lot of tallow
        candles, and a tin candlestick, and a gourd, and a tin cup, and a ratty
        old bedquilt off the bed, and a reticule with needles and pins and beeswax
        and buttons and thread and all such truck in it, and a hatchet and some
        nails, and a fishline as thick as my little finger with some monstrous
        hooks on it, and a roll of buckskin, and a leather dog-collar, and a
        horseshoe, and some vials of medicine that didn't have no label on them;
        and just as we was leaving I found a tolerable good curry-comb, and <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> he
        found a ratty old fiddle-bow, and a wooden leg. The straps was broke
        off of it, but, barring that, it was a good enough leg, though it was too
        long for me and not long enough for Jim, and we couldn't find the other
        one, though we hunted all around.

        And so, take it all around, we made a good haul. When we was ready
        to shove off we was a quarter of a mile below the island, and it was
        pretty broad day; so I made <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> lay down in the canoe and cover up with
        the quilt, because if he set up people could tell he was a nigger a good
        ways off. I paddled over to the Illinois shore, and drifted down
        most a half a mile doing it. I crept up the dead water under the
        bank, and hadn't no accidents and didn't see nobody. We got home all
        safe.

        after dinner Friday we was laying around in the grass at the upper end of
        the ridge, and got out of tobacco. I went to the cavern to get some,
        and found a rattlesnake in there. I killed him, and curled him up on
        the foot of Jim's blanket, ever so natural, thinking there'd be some fun
        when <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> found him there. Well, by night I forgot all about the

        He was barefooted, and the snake bit him right on the heel. That all
        comes of my being such a fool as to not remember that wherever you leave a
        dead snake its mate always comes there and curls around it. <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> told
        me to chop off the snake's head and throw it away, and then skin the body
        and roast a piece of it. I done it, and he eat it and said it would
        help cure him. He made me take off the rattles and tie them around his
        wrist, too. He said that that would help. Then I slid out
        quiet and throwed the snakes clear away amongst the bushes; for I warn't

        hadn't got to the end of it yet. He said he druther see the new moon
        over his left shoulder as much as a thousand times than take up a
        snake-skin in his hand. Well, I was getting to feel that way myself,
        though I've always <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckoned</orig><reg>thought</reg></choice></distinct> that looking at the new moon over your left

        him edgeways between two barn doors for a coffin, and buried him so, so
        they say, but I didn't see it. <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_pap">Pap</rs> told me. But anyway it all

        Well, the days went along, and the river went down between its banks
        again; and about the first thing we done was to bait one of the big hooks
        with a skinned rabbit and set it and catch a catfish that was as big as a
        man, being six foot two inches long, and weighed over two hundred pounds.
        We couldn't handle him, of course; he would a flung us into Illinois.
        We just set there and watched him rip and tear around till he
        drownded. We found a brass button in his stomach and a round ball,
        and lots of rubbage. We split the ball open with the hatchet, and
        there was a spool in it. <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> said he'd had it there a long time, to
        coat it over so and make a ball of it. It was as big a fish as was

        That was a good notion, too. So we shortened up one of the

        <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> hitched it behind with the hooks, and it was a fair fit. I

        look in and see my face was like looking down a joint of stove-pipe.

        I started across to the town from a little below the ferry-landing, and
        the drift of the current fetched me in at the bottom of the town. I
        tied up and started along the bank. There was a light burning in a
        little shanty that hadn't been lived in for a long time, and I wondered
        who had took up quarters there. I slipped up and peeped in at the
        window. There was a woman about forty year old in there knitting by
        a candle that was on a pine table. I didn't know her face; she was a
        stranger, for you couldn't start a face in that town that I didn't know.
        Now this was lucky, because I was weakening; I was getting afraid I
        had come; people might know my voice and find me out. But if this

      back comes old Finn, and went boo-hooing to <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_judge_thatcher">Judge Thatcher</rs> to get money to
      hunt for the nigger all over Illinois with. The judge gave him some, and
      that evening he got drunk, and was around till after midnight with a
      couple of mighty hard-looking strangers, and then went off with them.
      Well, he hain't come back sence, and they ain't looking for him back
      till this thing blows over a little, for people thinks now that he killed
      his boy and fixed things so folks would think robbers done it, and then
      he'd get Huck's money without having to bother a long time with a lawsuit.
      People do say he warn't any too good to do it. Oh, he's sly, I

      next door in the log shanty, and they happened to say hardly anybody ever
      goes to that island over yonder that they call Jackson's Island. Don't
      anybody live there? says I. No, nobody, says they. I didn't say any

      smoke over there, about the head of the island, a day or two before that,

      Well, the woman fell to talking about how hard times was, and how poor
      they had to live, and how the rats was as free as if they owned the place,
      and so forth and so on, and then I got easy again. She was right
      about the rats. You'd see one stick his nose out of a hole in the corner
      every little while. She said she had to have things handy to throw
      at them when she was alone, or they wouldn't give her no peace. She
      showed me a bar of lead twisted up into a knot, and said she was a good
      shot with it generly, but she'd wrenched her arm a day or two ago, and
      didn't know whether she could throw true now. But she watched for a
      chance, and directly banged away at a rat; but she missed him wide, and
      said "Ouch!" it hurt her arm so. Then she told me to try for the
      next one. I wanted to be getting away before the old man got back,
      but of course I didn't let on. I got the thing, and the first rat
      that showed his nose I let drive, and if he'd a stayed where he was he'd a
      been a tolerable sick rat. She said that was first-rate, and she
      <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckoned</orig><reg>thought</reg></choice></distinct> I would hive the next one. She went and got the lump of
      lead and fetched it back, and brought along a hank of yarn which she
      wanted me to help her with. I held up my two hands and she put the
      hank over them, and went on talking about her and her husband's matters.
      But she broke off to say:

    <p xml:id="B27EF0C6-45D2-4B83-BC6A-7296D693ECB3">

      So she dropped the lump into my lap just at that moment, and I clapped my
      legs together on it and she went on talking. But only about a
      minute. Then she took off the hank and looked me straight in the face, and
      very pleasant, and says:

      So I said it wouldn't be no use to try to play it any longer, and I would
      just make a clean breast and tell her everything, but she musn't go back
      on her promise. Then I told her my father and mother was dead, and
      the law had bound me out to a mean old farmer in the country thirty mile
      back from the river, and he treated me so bad I couldn't stand it no
      longer; he went away to be gone a couple of days, and so I took my chance
      and stole some of his daughter's old clothes and cleared out, and I had
      been three nights coming the thirty miles. I traveled nights, and
      hid daytimes and slept, and the bag of bread and meat I carried from home
      lasted me all the way, and I had a-plenty. I said I believed my

      not from the wrist and elbow, with your arm out to one side, like a boy.

      I went up the bank about fifty yards, and then I doubled on my tracks and

      jumped in, and was off in a hurry. I went up-stream far enough to
      make the head of the island, and then started across. I took off the
      sun-bonnet, for I didn't want no blinders on then. When I was about
      the middle I heard the clock begin to strike, so I stops and listens; the
      sound come faint over the water but clear&#x2014;eleven. When I
      struck the head of the island I never waited to blow, though I was most
      winded, but I shoved right into the timber where my old camp used to be,

      IT must a been close on to one o'clock when we got below the island at
      last, and the raft did seem to go mighty slow. If a boat was to come
      along we was going to take to the canoe and break for the Illinois shore;
      and it was well a boat didn't come, for we hadn't ever thought to put the
      gun in the canoe, or a fishing-line, or anything to eat. We was in
      ruther too much of a sweat to think of so many things. It warn't
      good judgment to put <hi rend="italics">everything</hi> on the raft.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="B8CC2C5C-FC00-484D-80FE-8B0A5A9BB955">
      If the men went to the island I just expect they found the camp fire I
      built, and watched it all night for <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> to come. Anyways, they
      stayed away from us, and if my building the fire never fooled them it
      warn't no fault of mine. I played it as low down on them as I could.

      When the first streak of day began to show we tied up to a towhead in a
      big bend on the Illinois side, and hacked off cottonwood branches with the
      hatchet, and covered up the raft with them so she looked like there had
      been a cave-in in the bank there. A tow-head is a sandbar that has
      cottonwoods on it as thick as harrow-teeth.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="FE08BB8E-264E-4113-8333-30687729B342">
      We had mountains on the Missouri shore and heavy timber on the Illinois
      side, and the channel was down the Missouri shore at that place, so we
      warn't afraid of anybody running across us. We laid there all day,
      and watched the rafts and steamboats spin down the Missouri shore, and
      up-bound steamboats fight the big river in the middle. I told Jim
      all about the time I had jabbering with that woman; and <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> said she was a
      smart one, and if she was to start after us herself she wouldn't set down
      and watch a camp fire&#x2014;no, sir, she'd fetch a dog. Well, then,
      I said, why couldn't she tell her husband to fetch a dog? <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> said
      he bet she did think of it by the time the men was ready to start, and he
      believed they must a gone up-town to get a dog and so they lost all that
      time, or else we wouldn't be here on a towhead sixteen or seventeen mile
      below the village&#x2014;no, indeedy, we would be in that same old town
      again. So I said I didn't care what was the reason they didn't get
      us as long as they didn't.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="0BA5B952-18AE-4761-9172-6FE98F5457EF">
      When it was beginning to come on dark we poked our heads out of the
      cottonwood thicket, and looked up and down and across; nothing in sight;
      so <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> took up some of the top planks of the raft and built a snug wigwam
      to get under in blazing weather and rainy, and to keep the things dry. Jim
      made a floor for the wigwam, and raised it a foot or more above the level
      of the raft, so now the blankets and all the traps was out of reach of
      steamboat waves. Right in the middle of the wigwam we made a layer
      of dirt about five or six inches deep with a frame around it for to hold
      it to its place; this was to build a fire on in sloppy weather or chilly;
      the wigwam would keep it from being seen. We made an extra
      steering-oar, too, because one of the others might get broke on a snag or
      something. We fixed up a short forked stick to hang the old lantern on,
      because we must always light the lantern whenever we see a steamboat
      coming down-stream, to keep from getting run over; but we wouldn't have to
      light it for up-stream boats unless we see we was in what they call a
      "crossing"; for the river was pretty high yet, very low banks being still
      a little under water; so up-bound boats didn't always run the channel, but
      hunted easy water.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="9107384A-3191-4289-8D65-273927CFEC4E">
      This second night we run between seven and eight hours, with a current
      that was making over four mile an hour. We catched fish and talked,
      and we took a swim now and then to keep off sleepiness. It was kind
      of solemn, drifting down the big, still river, laying on our backs looking
      up at the stars, and we didn't ever feel like talking loud, and it warn't
      often that we laughed&#x2014;only a little kind of a low chuckle. We
      had mighty good weather as a general thing, and nothing ever happened to
      us at all&#x2014;that night, nor the next, nor the next.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="2175B1B8-E710-412A-B16B-0AD298F95E42">
      Every night we passed towns, some of them away up on black hillsides,
      nothing but just a shiny bed of lights; not a house could you see. The
      fifth night we passed St. Louis, and it was like the whole world lit up.
      In St. Petersburg they used to say there was twenty or thirty thousand
      people in St. Louis, but I never believed it till I see that wonderful
      spread of lights at two o'clock that still night. There warn't a
      sound there; everybody was asleep.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="01B07733-8222-4B5D-8480-3060E9C56D52">
      Every night now I used to slip ashore towards ten o'clock at some little
      village, and buy ten or fifteen cents' worth of meal or bacon or other
      stuff to eat; and sometimes I lifted a chicken that warn't roosting
      comfortable, and took him along. <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_pap">Pap</rs> always said, take a chicken
      when you get a chance, because if you don't want him yourself you can easy
      find somebody that does, and a good deed ain't ever forgot. I never
      see pap when he didn't want the chicken himself, but that is what he used
      to say, anyway.

      Mornings before daylight I slipped into cornfields and borrowed a
      watermelon, or a mushmelon, or a punkin, or some new corn, or things of
      that kind. <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_pap">Pap</rs> always said it warn't no harm to borrow things if you
      was meaning to pay them back some time; but the widow said it warn't
      anything but a soft name for stealing, and no decent body would do it.
      <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> said he <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckoned</orig><reg>thought</reg></choice></distinct> the widow was partly right and pap was partly
      right; so the best way would be for us to pick out two or three things
      from the list and say we wouldn't borrow them any more&#x2014;then he
      <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckoned</orig><reg>thought</reg></choice></distinct> it wouldn't be no harm to borrow the others. So we talked
      it over all one night, drifting along down the river, trying to make up
      our minds whether to drop the watermelons, or the cantelopes, or the
      mushmelons, or what. But towards daylight we got it all settled
      satisfactory, and concluded to drop crabapples and p'simmons. We
      warn't feeling just right before that, but it was all comfortable now.
      I was glad the way it come out, too, because crabapples ain't ever
      good, and the p'simmons wouldn't be ripe for two or three months yet.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="858C9FC4-A8CB-44F5-B045-4FE7F76F862E">
      We shot a water-fowl now and then that got up too early in the morning or
      didn't go to bed early enough in the evening. Take it all round, we
      lived pretty high.

    <p xml:id="6E3622FD-1608-4321-B8B8-8FEC9B0C8D84">
      The fifth night below St. Louis we had a big storm after midnight, with a
      power of thunder and lightning, and the rain poured down in a solid sheet.
      We stayed in the wigwam and let the raft take care of itself. When the
      lightning glared out we could see a big straight river ahead, and high,
      rocky bluffs on both sides. By and by says I, "Hel-<hi rend="italics">lo</hi>, Jim, looky
      yonder!" It was a steamboat that had killed herself on a rock. We
      was drifting straight down for her. The lightning showed her very
      distinct. She was leaning over, with part of her upper deck above
      water, and you could see every little chimbly-guy clean and clear, and a
      chair by the big bell, with an old slouch hat hanging on the back of it,
      when the flashes come.

      Well, it being away in the night and stormy, and all so mysterious-like, I
      felt just the way any other boy would a felt when I see that wreck laying
      there so mournful and lonesome in the middle of the river. I wanted
      to get aboard of her and slink around a little, and see what there was
      there. So I says:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="0849D454-184C-43E1-B5DF-6BD61BFCF8B3">
      "Le's land on her, <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs>."

      But <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> was dead against it at first. He says:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="5EF3C89D-041E-4850-8066-9ABEB1D710C4">
      "I doan' want to go fool'n 'long er no wrack. We's doin' blame'
      well, en we better let blame' well alone, as de good book says. Like
      as not dey's a watchman on dat wrack."

    <p xml:id="FD361E18-CBA0-4A60-8F6F-40C54A88B843">
      "Watchman your grandmother," I says; "there ain't nothing to watch but the
      texas and the pilot-house; and do you <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckon</orig><reg>think</reg></choice></distinct> anybody's going to resk his
      life for a texas and a pilot-house such a night as this, when it's likely
      to break up and wash off down the river any minute?" <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> couldn't
      say nothing to that, so he didn't try. "And besides," I says, "we
      might borrow something worth having out of the captain's stateroom. Seegars,
      I bet you&#x2014;and cost five cents apiece, solid cash. Steamboat
      captains is always rich, and get sixty dollars a month, and <hi rend="italics">they</hi> don't
      care a cent what a thing costs, you know, long as they want it. Stick
      a candle in your pocket; I can't rest, Jim, till we give her a rummaging.
      Do you <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckon</orig><reg>think</reg></choice></distinct> <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom Sawyer</rs>would ever go by this thing? Not for
      pie, he wouldn't. He'd call it an adventure&#x2014;that's what he'd call
      it; and he'd land on that wreck if it was his last act. And wouldn't
      he throw style into it?&#x2014;wouldn't he spread himself, nor nothing?
      Why, you'd think it was Christopher C'lumbus discovering
      Kingdom-Come. I wish <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom Sawyer</rs><hi rend="italics">was</hi> here."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="7612C3D9-9693-46EE-B6E9-39A63D65BA51">
      <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> he grumbled a little, but give in. He said we mustn't talk any
      more than we could help, and then talk mighty low. The lightning
      showed us the wreck again just in time, and we fetched the stabboard
      derrick, and made fast there.

    <p xml:id="2E53DFE0-4A40-4BE3-9994-D1BF7EE8A86B">
      The deck was high out here. We went sneaking down the slope of it to
      labboard, in the dark, towards the texas, feeling our way slow with our
      feet, and spreading our hands out to fend off the guys, for it was so dark
      we couldn't see no sign of them. Pretty soon we struck the forward
      end of the skylight, and clumb on to it; and the next step fetched us in
      front of the captain's door, which was open, and by Jimminy, away down
      through the texas-hall we see a light! and all in the same second we seem
      to hear low voices in yonder!

      <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> whispered and said he was feeling powerful sick, and told me to come
      along. I says, all right, and was going to start for the raft; but
      just then I heard a voice wail out and say:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="7ACD9AAB-DFC2-4719-AFD8-C94146FE2FC4">
      "Oh, please don't, boys; I swear I won't ever tell!"
    </p>
    <p xml:id="D780566B-2E46-48E8-84AC-2E1BC6F8F489">
      Another voice said, pretty loud:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="54B62271-040D-4F57-B0F3-4FAB6B08BFA1">
      "It's a lie, <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> Turner. You've acted this way before. You
      always want more'n your share of the truck, and you've always got it, too,
      because you've swore 't if you didn't you'd tell. But this time
      you've said it jest one time too many. You're the meanest,
      treacherousest hound in this country."
    </p>
    <p xml:id="1CEB9DEC-3AB7-460A-9F18-339E15ECB726">
      By this time <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> was gone for the raft. I was just a-biling with
      curiosity; and I says to myself, <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom Sawyer</rs>wouldn't back out now, and so
      I won't either; I'm a-going to see what's going on here. So I
      dropped on my hands and knees in the little passage, and crept aft in the
      dark till there warn't but one stateroom betwixt me and the cross-hall of
      the texas. Then in there I see a man stretched on the floor and tied
      hand and foot, and two men standing over him, and one of them had a dim
      lantern in his hand, and the other one had a pistol. This one kept
      pointing the pistol at the man's head on the floor, and saying:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="FFEB15E0-1042-4CF2-882D-D32AEEBB19BF">
      "I'd <hi rend="italics">like</hi> to! And I orter, too&#x2014;a mean skunk!"

      And every time he said that the man with the lantern would laugh and say:

      "'Deed you <hi rend="italics">ain't!</hi> You never said no truer thing 'n that, you bet

      "I don't want to, Jake Packard. I'm for killin' him&#x2014;and didn't

      "Bless yo' heart for <distinct type="l_huck"><choice><orig>them</orig><reg>those</reg></choice></distinct> words, Jake Packard! I'll never forgit you
      long's I live!" says the man on the floor, sort of blubbering.
    </p>
    <p xml:id="8AD7E2E7-96A2-4BEA-A227-9ACDE256C116">
      Packard didn't take no notice of that, but hung up his lantern on a nail
      and started towards where I was there in the dark, and motioned Bill to
      come. I crawfished as fast as I could about two yards, but the boat
      slanted so that I couldn't make very good time; so to keep from getting
      run over and catched I crawled into a stateroom on the upper side. The
      man came a-pawing along in the dark, and when Packard got to my stateroom,
      he says:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="704EB496-9DF8-40A2-B28A-E7B8FC8955DF">

      And in he come, and Bill after him. But before they got in I was up
      in the upper berth, cornered, and sorry I come. Then they stood
      there, with their hands on the ledge of the berth, and talked. I
      couldn't see them, but I could tell where they was by the whisky they'd
      been having. I was glad I didn't drink whisky; but it wouldn't made
      much difference anyway, because most of the time they couldn't a treed me
      because I didn't breathe. I was too scared. And, besides, a
      body <hi rend="italics">couldn't</hi> breathe and hear such talk. They talked low and
      earnest. Bill wanted to kill Turner. He says:
    </p>
    <p xml:id="5B417944-9509-46A7-9B75-AAD0F416C476">
      "He's said he'll tell, and he will. If we was to give both our
      shares to him <hi rend="italics">now</hi> it wouldn't make no difference after the row and the way
      we've served him. Shore's you're born, he'll turn State's evidence;

    <p xml:id="936A83A5-49F9-4C2B-85B5-44B515889EF0">
      "So'm I," says Packard, very quiet.

      "Blame it, I'd sorter begun to think you wasn't. Well, then, that's

      Shooting's good, but there's quieter ways if the thing's <hi rend="italics">got</hi> to be done.
      But what I say is this: it ain't good sense to go court'n around
      after a halter if you can git at what you're up to in some way that's jist
      as good and at the same time don't bring you into no resks. Ain't

      "Well, my idea is this: we'll rustle around and gather up whatever
      pickins we've overlooked in the staterooms, and shove for shore and hide
      the truck. Then we'll wait. Now I say it ain't a-goin' to be more'n
      two hours befo' this wrack breaks up and washes off down the river. See?
      He'll be drownded, and won't have nobody to blame for it but his own self.
      I <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckon</orig><reg>think</reg></choice></distinct> that's a considerble sight better 'n killin' of him. I'm
      unfavorable to killin' a man as long as you can git aroun' it; it ain't

      THE news was all over town in two minutes, and you could see the people
      tearing down on the run from every which way, some of them putting on
      their coats as they come. Pretty soon we was in the middle of a
      crowd, and the noise of the tramping was like a soldier march. The
      windows and dooryards was full; and every minute somebody would say, over
      a fence:

      When we got to the house the street in front of it was packed, and the
      three girls was standing in the door. Mary Jane <hi rend="italics">was</hi> red-headed, but
      that don't make no difference, she was most awful beautiful, and her face
      and her eyes was all lit up like glory, she was so glad her uncles was
      come. The king he spread his arms, and Mary Jane she jumped for them, and
      the hare-lip jumped for the duke, and there they had it! Everybody
      most, leastways women, cried for joy to see them meet again at last and
      have such good times.

      Then the king he hunched <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_the_duke">the duke</rs> private—I see him do it—and
      then he looked around and see the coffin, over in the corner on two
      chairs; so then him and the duke, with a hand across each other's
      shoulder, and t'other hand to their eyes, walked slow and solemn over
      there, everybody dropping back to give them room, and all the talk and
      noise stopping, people saying "Sh!" and all the men taking their hats off
      and drooping their heads, so you could a heard a pin fall. And when
      they got there they bent over and looked in the coffin, and took one
      sight, and then they bust out a-crying so you could a heard them to
      Orleans, most; and then they put their arms around each other's necks, and
      hung their chins over each other's shoulders; and then for three minutes,
      or maybe four, I never see two men leak the way they done. And, mind
      you, everybody was doing the same; and the place was that damp I never see
      anything like it. Then one of them got on one side of the coffin, and
      t'other on t'other side, and they kneeled down and rested their foreheads
      on the coffin, and let on to pray all to themselves. Well, when it
      come to that it worked the crowd like you never see anything like it, and
      everybody broke down and went to sobbing right out loud—the poor
      girls, too; and every woman, nearly, went up to the girls, without saying
      a word, and kissed them, solemn, on the forehead, and then put their hand
      on their head, and looked up towards the sky, with the tears running down,
      and then busted out and went off sobbing and swabbing, and give the next
      woman a show. I never see anything so disgusting.

      Well, by and by the king he gets up and comes forward a little, and works
      himself up and slobbers out a speech, all full of tears and flapdoodle
      about its being a sore trial for him and his poor brother to lose the
      diseased, and to miss seeing diseased alive after the long journey of four
      thousand mile, but it's a trial that's sweetened and sanctified to us by
      this dear sympathy and these holy tears, and so he thanks them out of his
      heart and out of his brother's heart, because out of their mouths they
      can't, words being too weak and cold, and all that kind of rot and slush,
      till it was just sickening; and then he blubbers out a pious goody-goody
      Amen, and turns himself loose and goes to crying fit to bust.

      And the minute the words were out of his mouth somebody over in the crowd
      struck up the doxolojer, and everybody joined in with all their might, and
      it just warmed you up and made you feel as good as church letting out.
      Music is a good thing; and after all that soul-butter and hogwash I never
      see it freshen up things so, and sound so honest and bully.

      Then the king begins to work his jaw again, and says how him and his
      nieces would be glad if a few of the main principal friends of the family
      would take supper here with them this evening, and help set up with the
      ashes of the diseased; and says if his poor brother laying yonder could
      speak he knows who he would name, for they was names that was very dear to
      him, and mentioned often in his letters; and so he will name the same, to
      wit, as follows, vizz.:—Rev. Mr. Hobson, and Deacon Lot Hovey, and
      Mr. Ben Rucker, and Abner Shackleford, and Levi Bell, and Dr. Robinson,
      and their wives, and the widow Bartley.
    </p>
   <p xml:id="22B793FC-6189-4EF4-9F97-2796053297CC">
      Rev. Hobson and Dr. Robinson was down to the end of the town a-hunting
      together—that is, I mean the doctor was shipping a sick man to
      t'other world, and the preacher was pinting him right. Lawyer Bell
      was away up to Louisville on business. But the rest was on hand, and
      so they all come and shook hands with the king and thanked him and talked
      to him; and then they shook hands with <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_the_duke">the duke</rs> and didn't say nothing,
      but just kept a-smiling and bobbing their heads like a passel of sapheads
      whilst he made all sorts of signs with his hands and said "Goo-goo—goo-goo-goo"
      all the time, like a baby that can't talk.

   <p xml:id="A8A834D4-C338-45AA-9225-7AAF51344054">
      So the king he blattered along, and managed to inquire about pretty much
      everybody and dog in town, by his name, and mentioned all sorts of little
      things that happened one time or another in the town, or to George's
      family, or to Peter. And he always let on that Peter wrote him the
      things; but that was a lie: he got every blessed one of them out of
      that young flathead that we canoed up to the steamboat.

   <p xml:id="9EE7AEC2-6A3F-44CC-B9E8-FC232FEFBAC5">
      Then Mary Jane she fetched the letter her father left behind, and the king
      he read it out loud and cried over it. It give the dwelling-house
      and three thousand dollars, gold, to the girls; and it give the tanyard
      (which was doing a good business), along with some other houses and land
      (worth about seven thousand), and three thousand dollars in gold to Harvey
      and William, and told where the six thousand cash was hid down cellar.
      So these two frauds said they'd go and fetch it up, and have
      everything square and above-board; and told me to come with a candle.
      We shut the cellar door behind us, and when they found the bag they
      spilt it out on the floor, and it was a lovely sight, all <distinct type="l_huck"><choice><orig>them</orig><reg>those</reg></choice></distinct>
      yaller-boys. My, the way the king's eyes did shine! He slaps

      <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_the_duke">The duke</rs> allowed it did. They pawed the yaller-boys, and sifted them
      through their fingers and let them jingle down on the floor; and the king

      Most everybody would a been satisfied with the pile, and took it on trust;
      but no, they must count it. So they counts it, and it comes out four
      hundred and fifteen dollars short. Says the king:

      When we got up-stairs everybody gethered around the table, and the king he

      a-listening and looking, and not saying anything; and nobody saying

      couldn't stand it no more; so he writes on a little scrap of paper,

      WELL, when they was all gone the king he asks Mary Jane how they was off
      for spare rooms, and she said she had one spare room, which would do for
      Uncle William, and she'd give her own room to Uncle Harvey, which was a
      little bigger, and she would turn into the room with her sisters and sleep
      on a cot; and up garret was a little cubby, with a pallet in it. The king
      said the cubby would do for his valley—meaning me.

      So Mary Jane took us up, and she showed them their rooms, which was plain
      but nice. She said she'd have her frocks and a lot of other traps
      took out of her room if they was in Uncle Harvey's way, but he said they
      warn't. The frocks was hung along the wall, and before them was a
      curtain made out of calico that hung down to the floor. There was an
      old hair trunk in one corner, and a guitar-box in another, and all sorts
      of little knickknacks and jimcracks around, like girls brisken up a room
      with. The king said it was all the more homely and more pleasanter
      for these fixings, and so don't disturb them. The duke's room was
      pretty small, but plenty good enough, and so was my cubby.

      That night they had a big supper, and all them men and women was there,
      and I stood behind the king and the duke's chairs and waited on them, and
      the niggers waited on the rest. Mary Jane she set at the head of the
      table, with Susan alongside of her, and said how bad the biscuits was, and
      how mean the preserves was, and how ornery and tough the fried chickens
      was—and all that kind of rot, the way women always do for to force
      out compliments; and the people all knowed everything was tiptop, and said
      so—said "How <hi rend="italics">do</hi> you get biscuits to brown so nice?" and "Where, for
      the land's sake, <hi rend="italics">did</hi> you get these amaz'n pickles?" and all that kind of

      So then I lit out—for bed, I said, meaning some time or another.
      When I got by myself I went to thinking the thing over. I says
      to myself, shall I go to that doctor, private, and blow on these frauds?
      No—that won't do. He might tell who told him; then the king
      and <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_the_duke">the duke</rs> would make it warm for me. Shall I go, private, and
      tell Mary Jane? No—I dasn't do it. Her face would give them a
      hint, sure; they've got the money, and they'd slide right out and get away
      with it. If she was to fetch in help I'd get mixed up in the
      business before it was done with, I judge. No; there ain't no good
      way but one. I got to steal that money, somehow; and I got to steal
      it some way that they won't suspicion that I done it. They've got a good
      thing here, and they ain't a-going to leave till they've played this
      family and this town for all they're worth, so I'll find a chance time
      enough. I'll steal it and hide it; and by and by, when I'm away down the
      river, I'll write a letter and tell Mary Jane where it's hid. But I
      better hive it tonight if I can, because the doctor maybe hasn't let up as
      much as he lets on he has; he might scare them out of here yet.

      So, thinks I, I'll go and search <distinct type="l_huck"><choice><orig>them</orig><reg>those</reg></choice></distinct> rooms. Upstairs the hall was
      dark, but I found the duke's room, and started to paw around it with my
      hands; but I recollected it wouldn't be much like the king to let anybody
      else take care of that money but his own self; so then I went to his room
      and begun to paw around there. But I see I couldn't do nothing
      without a candle, and I dasn't light one, of course. So I judged I'd
      got to do the other thing—lay for them and eavesdrop. About
      that time I hears their footsteps coming, and was going to skip under the
      bed; I reached for it, but it wasn't where I thought it would be; but I
      touched the curtain that hid Mary Jane's frocks, so I jumped in behind
      that and snuggled in amongst the gowns, and stood there perfectly still.

      before I could think more than about a half a thought, and he never

      in the straw tick that was under the feather-bed, and crammed it in a foot
      or two amongst the straw and said it was all right now, because a nigger

      I crept to their doors and listened; they was snoring. So I tiptoed
      along, and got down stairs all right. There warn't a sound
      anywheres. I peeped through a crack of the dining-room door, and see
      the men that was watching the corpse all sound asleep on their chairs.
      The door was open into the parlor, where the corpse was laying, and
      there was a candle in both rooms. I passed along, and the parlor door was
      open; but I see there warn't nobody in there but the remainders of Peter;
      so I shoved on by; but the front door was locked, and the key wasn't
      there. Just then I heard somebody coming down the stairs, back
      behind me. I run in the parlor and took a swift look around, and the
      only place I see to hide the bag was in the coffin. The lid was
      shoved along about a foot, showing the dead man's face down in there, with
      a wet cloth over it, and his shroud on. I tucked the money-bag in
      under the lid, just down beyond where his hands was crossed, which made me
      creep, they was so cold, and then I run back across the room and in behind
      the door.

   <p xml:id="D84ABDED-6AFF-4CC7-B748-F2DDD53D7B5E">
      The person coming was Mary Jane. She went to the coffin, very soft,
      and kneeled down and looked in; then she put up her handkerchief, and I
      see she begun to cry, though I couldn't hear her, and her back was to me.
      I slid out, and as I passed the dining-room I thought I'd make sure
     <distinct type="l_huck"><choice><orig>them</orig><reg>those</reg></choice></distinct> watchers hadn't seen me; so I looked through the crack, and

      I slipped up to bed, feeling ruther blue, on accounts of the thing playing
      out that way after I had took so much trouble and run so much resk about
      it. Says I, if it could stay where it is, all right; because when we
      get down the river a hundred mile or two I could write back to Mary Jane,
      and she could dig him up again and get it; but that ain't the thing that's
      going to happen; the thing that's going to happen is, the money 'll be
      found when they come to screw on the lid. Then the king 'll get it
      again, and it 'll be a long day before he gives anybody another chance to
      smouch it from him. Of course I <hi rend="italics">wanted</hi> to slide down and get it out of

      and pretty soon some of <distinct type="l_huck"><choice><orig>them</orig><reg>those</reg></choice></distinct> watchers would begin to stir, and I might get
      catched—catched with six thousand dollars in my hands that nobody

      set all our chairs in rows, and borrowed more from the neighbors till the
      hall and the parlor and the dining-room was full. I see the coffin
      lid was the way it was before, but I dasn't go to look in under it, with
      folks around.
    </p>
   <p xml:id="DC1DAE6C-EB1C-4A6D-B5CB-B96BC09FF2F3">
      Then the people begun to flock in, and the beats and the girls took seats
      in the front row at the head of the coffin, and for a half an hour the
      people filed around slow, in single rank, and looked down at the dead
      man's face a minute, and some dropped in a tear, and it was all very still
      and solemn, only the girls and the beats holding handkerchiefs to their
      eyes and keeping their heads bent, and sobbing a little. There
      warn't no other sound but the scraping of the feet on the floor and
      blowing noses—because people always blows them more at a funeral
      than they do at other places except church.

      When the place was packed full the undertaker he slid around in his black
      gloves with his softy soothering ways, putting on the last touches, and
      getting people and things all ship-shape and comfortable, and making no
      more sound than a cat. He never spoke; he moved people around, he
      squeezed in late ones, he opened up passageways, and done it with nods,
      and signs with his hands. Then he took his place over against the
      wall. He was the softest, glidingest, stealthiest man I ever see; and
      there warn't no more smile to him than there is to a ham.

      They had borrowed a melodeum—a sick one; and when everything was
      ready a young woman set down and worked it, and it was pretty skreeky and
      colicky, and everybody joined in and sung, and Peter was the only one that
      had a good thing, according to my notion. Then the Reverend Hobson
      opened up, slow and solemn, and begun to talk; and straight off the most
      outrageous row busted out in the cellar <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>a body</orig><reg>somebody</reg></choice></distinct> ever heard; it was only one
      dog, but he made a most powerful racket, and he kept it up right along;
      the parson he had to stand there, over the coffin, and wait—you
      couldn't hear yourself think. It was right down awkward, and nobody
      didn't seem to know what to do. But pretty soon they see that
      long-legged undertaker make a sign to the preacher as much as to say,
      "Don't you worry—just depend on me." Then he stooped down and
      begun to glide along the wall, just his shoulders showing over the
      people's heads. So he glided along, and the powwow and racket
      getting more and more outrageous all the time; and at last, when he had
      gone around two sides of the room, he disappears down cellar. Then
      in about two seconds we heard a whack, and the dog he finished up with a
      most amazing howl or two, and then everything was dead still, and the
      parson begun his solemn talk where he left off. In a minute or two
      here comes this undertaker's back and shoulders gliding along the wall
      again; and so he glided and glided around three sides of the room, and
      then rose up, and shaded his mouth with his hands, and stretched his neck
      out towards the preacher, over the people's heads, and says, in a kind of
      a coarse whisper, "<hi rend="italics">He had a rat</hi>!" Then he drooped down and glided
      along the wall again to his place. You could see it was a great
      satisfaction to the people, because naturally they wanted to know. A
      little thing like that don't cost nothing, and it's just the little things
      that makes a man to be looked up to and liked. There warn't no more
      popular man in town than what that undertaker was.

      Well, the funeral sermon was very good, but pison long and tiresome; and
      then the king he shoved in and got off some of his usual rubbage, and at
      last the job was through, and the undertaker begun to sneak up on the
      coffin with his screw-driver. I was in a sweat then, and watched him
      pretty keen. But he never meddled at all; just slid the lid along as soft
      as mush, and screwed it down tight and fast. So there I was! I
      didn't know whether the money was in there or not. So, says I,
      s'pose somebody has hogged that bag on the sly?—now how do I know
      whether to write to Mary Jane or not? S'pose she dug him up and didn't
      find nothing, what would she think of me? Blame it, I says, I might get
      hunted up and jailed; I'd better lay low and keep dark, and not write at
      all; the thing's awful mixed now; trying to better it, I've worsened it a

      The king he visited around in the evening, and sweetened everybody up, and
      made himself ever so friendly; and he give out the idea that his
      congregation over in England would be in a sweat about him, so he must
      hurry and settle up the estate right away and leave for home. He was
      very sorry he was so pushed, and so was everybody; they wished he could
      stay longer, but they said they could see it couldn't be done. And
      he said of course him and William would take the girls home with them; and
      that pleased everybody too, because then the girls would be well fixed and
      amongst their own relations; and it pleased the girls, too—tickled
      them so they clean forgot they ever had a trouble in the world; and told
      him to sell out as quick as he wanted to, they would be ready. <distinct type="l_huck"><choice><orig>Them</orig><reg>Those</reg></choice></distinct>

      Well, blamed if the king didn't bill the house and the niggers and all the

      So the next day after the funeral, along about noon-time, the girls' joy
      got the first jolt. A couple of nigger traders come along, and the
      king sold them the niggers reasonable, for three-day drafts as they called
      it, and away they went, the two sons up the river to Memphis, and their
      mother down the river to Orleans. I thought <distinct type="l_huck"><choice><orig>them</orig><reg>those</reg></choice></distinct> poor girls and <distinct type="l_huck"><choice><orig>them</orig><reg>those</reg></choice></distinct>
      niggers would break their hearts for grief; they cried around each other,
      and took on so it most made me down sick to see it. The girls said
      they hadn't ever dreamed of seeing the family separated or sold away from
      the town. I can't ever get it out of my memory, the sight of <distinct type="l_huck"><choice><orig>them</orig><reg>those</reg></choice></distinct>
      poor miserable girls and niggers hanging around each other's necks and

      The thing made a big stir in the town, too, and a good many come out
      flatfooted and said it was scandalous to separate the mother and the
      children that way. It injured the frauds some; but the old fool he

      It was nuts for the crowd, though maybe not for the king's friends; so we
      all started. It was about sundown. The doctor he led me along

      We all got in a big room in the hotel, and lit up some candles, and
      fetched in the new couple. First, the doctor says:

      "I don't wish to be too hard on these two men, but I think they're frauds,

   <p xml:id="75742223-052C-4411-B59F-0818E0179202">
      Everybody agreed to that. So I judged they had our gang in a pretty

      sorrowful, and says:

      The doctor and several said "Shucks!" and I see nobody didn't altogether
      believe him. One man asked me if I see the niggers steal it. I
      said no, but I see them sneaking out of the room and hustling away, and I
      never thought nothing, only I <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckoned</orig><reg>thought</reg></choice></distinct> they was afraid they had waked up
      my master and was trying to get away before he made trouble with them.

      Well, then they sailed in on the general investigation, and there we had
      it, up and down, hour in, hour out, and nobody never said a word about
      supper, nor ever seemed to think about it—and so they kept it up,
      and kept it up; and it <hi rend="italics">was</hi> the worst mixed-up thing you ever see. They
      made the king tell his yarn, and they made the old gentleman tell his'n;
      and anybody but a lot of prejudiced chuckleheads would a <hi rend="italics">seen</hi> that the old
      gentleman was spinning truth and t'other one lies. And by and by
      they had me up to tell what I knowed. The king he give me a
      left-handed look out of the corner of his eye, and so I knowed enough to
      talk on the right side. I begun to tell about Sheffield, and how we
      lived there, and all about the English Wilkses, and so on; but I didn't
      get pretty fur till the doctor begun to laugh; and Levi Bell, the lawyer,
      says:

      I didn't care nothing for the compliment, but I was glad to be let off,
      anyway.
    </p>
   <p xml:id="DB4815E5-2295-4B5B-8523-5FD2722CF9F4">
      The doctor he started to say something, and turns and says:

      "If you'd been in town at first, Levi Bell—" The king broke in and
      reached out his hand, and says:

   <p xml:id="A29CCDCB-522F-4AD0-A320-BC1AF3D0992F">
      "Why, is this my poor dead brother's old friend that he's wrote so often

    </p>
   <p xml:id="5A6C4193-BE37-4FF4-B9F8-A3B5D8CF3A45">
      The lawyer and him shook hands, and the lawyer smiled and looked pleased,
      and they talked right along awhile, and then got to one side and talked
      low; and at last the lawyer speaks up and says:
    </p>
   <p xml:id="719EC286-DC89-472D-88D1-0859F9FDAE48">
      "That 'll fix it. I'll take the order and send it, along with your

    </p>
   <p xml:id="1A8B8D08-977D-48D4-95E7-D66FA0086E3D">
      So they got some paper and a pen, and the king he set down and twisted his
      head to one side, and chawed his tongue, and scrawled off something; and
      then they give the pen to the duke—and then for the first time the
      duke looked sick. But he took the pen and wrote. So then the
      lawyer turns to the new old gentleman and says:
    </p>
   <p xml:id="7295E20B-50AC-4DEE-AA2F-8E26DF6F4295">

      Blamed if the king didn't have to brace up mighty quick, or he'd a squshed

      out, so they'd thin out, and him and <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_the_duke">the duke</rs> could break loose and get

      When they got there they swarmed into the graveyard and washed over it
      like an overflow. And when they got to the grave they found they had
      about a hundred times as many shovels as they wanted, but nobody hadn't
      thought to fetch a lantern. But they sailed into digging anyway by
      the flicker of the lightning, and sent a man to the nearest house, a half
      a mile off, to borrow one.

      So they dug and dug like everything; and it got awful dark, and the rain
      started, and the wind swished and swushed along, and the lightning come
      brisker and brisker, and the thunder boomed; but <distinct type="l_huck"><choice><orig>them</orig><reg>those</reg></choice></distinct> people never took no
      notice of it, they was so full of this business; and one minute you could
      see everything and every face in that big crowd, and the shovelfuls of

      all out, and you couldn't see nothing at all.

      At last they got out the coffin and begun to unscrew the lid, and then
      such another crowding and shouldering and shoving as there was, to scrouge
      in and get a sight, you never see; and in the dark, that way, it was
      awful. Hines he hurt my wrist dreadful pulling and tugging so, and I
      <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckon</orig><reg>think</reg></choice></distinct> he clean forgot I was in the world, he was so excited and panting.

      All of a sudden the lightning let go a perfect sluice of white glare, and

      Hines let out a whoop, like everybody else, and dropped my wrist and give
      a big surge to bust his way in and get a look, and the way I lit out and
      shinned for the road in the dark there ain't nobody can tell.

   <p xml:id="2021CA07-D0FE-4E50-BCAC-DAAE36FEF184">
      I had the road all to myself, and I fairly flew—leastways, I had it
      all to myself except the solid dark, and the now-and-then glares, and the
      buzzing of the rain, and the thrashing of the wind, and the splitting of
      the thunder; and sure as you are born I did clip it along!

      When I struck the town I see there warn't nobody out in the storm, so I
      never hunted for no back streets, but humped it straight through the main
      one; and when I begun to get towards our house I aimed my eye and set it.
      No light there; the house all dark—which made me feel sorry and
      disappointed, I didn't know why. But at last, just as I was sailing
      by, <hi rend="italics">flash</hi> comes the light in Mary Jane's window! and my heart swelled up
      sudden, like to bust; and the same second the house and all was behind me
      in the dark, and wasn't ever going to be before me no more in this world.
      She <hi rend="italics">was</hi> the best girl I ever see, and had the most sand.

      The minute I was far enough above the town to see I could make the
      towhead, I begun to look sharp for a boat to borrow, and the first time
      the lightning showed me one that wasn't chained I snatched it and shoved.
      It was a canoe, and warn't fastened with nothing but a rope. The
      towhead was a rattling big distance off, away out there in the middle of
      the river, but I didn't lose no time; and when I struck the raft at last I
      was so fagged I would a just laid down to blow and gasp if I could
      afforded it. But I didn't. As I sprung aboard I sung out:

      of joy; but when I glimpsed him in the lightning my heart shot up in my
      mouth and I went overboard backwards; for I forgot he was old King Lear
      and a drownded A-rab all in one, and it most scared the livers and lights
      out of me. But <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> fished me out, and was going to hug me and bless
      me, and so on, he was so glad I was back and we was shut of the king and

      heels a few times—I couldn't help it; but about the third crack I
      noticed a sound that I knowed mighty well, and held my breath and listened
      and waited; and sure enough, when the next flash busted out over the
      water, here they come!—and just a-laying to their oars and making

      and before long <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_the_duke">the duke</rs> tackled HIS bottle; and so in about a half an
      hour they was as thick as thieves again, and the tighter they got the
      lovinger they got, and went off a-snoring in each other's arms. They
      both got powerful mellow, but I noticed the king didn't get mellow enough
      to forget to remember to not deny about hiding the money-bag again. That
      made me feel easy and satisfied. Of course when they got to snoring
      we had a long gabble, and I told <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> everything.

      WE dasn't stop again at any town for days and days; kept right along down
      the river. We was down south in the warm weather now, and a mighty
      long ways from home. We begun to come to trees with Spanish moss on
      them, hanging down from the limbs like long, gray beards. It was the
      first I ever see it growing, and it made the woods look solemn and dismal.
      So now the frauds <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckoned</orig><reg>thought</reg></choice></distinct> they was out of danger, and they begun to
      work the villages again.
    </p>
   <p xml:id="78F05862-6824-4499-9C0D-C38FD130FF18">
      First they done a lecture on temperance; but they didn't make enough for
      them both to get drunk on. Then in another village they started a
      dancing-school; but they didn't know no more how to dance than a kangaroo
      does; so the first prance they made the general public jumped in and
      pranced them out of town. Another time they tried to go at
      yellocution; but they didn't yellocute long till the audience got up and
      give them a solid good cussing, and made them skip out. They tackled
      missionarying, and mesmerizing, and doctoring, and telling fortunes, and a
      little of everything; but they couldn't seem to have no luck. So at
      last they got just about dead broke, and laid around the raft as she
      floated along, thinking and thinking, and never saying nothing, by the
      half a day at a time, and dreadful blue and desperate.

   <p xml:id="998221C7-3B71-4728-BA8C-93A65199C02D">
      And at last they took a change and begun to lay their heads together in
      the wigwam and talk low and confidential two or three hours at a time. Jim
      and me got uneasy. We didn't like the look of it. We judged
      they was studying up some kind of worse deviltry than ever. We
      turned it over and over, and at last we made up our minds they was going
      to break into somebody's house or store, or was going into the
      counterfeit-money business, or something. So then we was pretty scared,
      and made up an agreement that we wouldn't have nothing in the world to do
      with such actions, and if we ever got the least show we would give them
      the cold shake and clear out and leave them behind. Well, early one
      morning we hid the raft in a good, safe place about two mile below a
      little bit of a shabby village named Pikesville, and the king he went
      ashore and told us all to stay hid whilst he went up to town and smelt
      around to see if anybody had got any wind of the Royal Nonesuch there yet.
      ("House to rob, you <hi rend="italics">mean</hi>," says I to myself; "and when you get through
      robbing it you'll come back here and wonder what has become of me and Jim
      and the raft—and you'll have to take it out in wondering.") And he
      said if he warn't back by midday <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_the_duke">the duke</rs> and me would know it was all
      right, and we was to come along.
    </p>
   <p xml:id="DD9C7AC3-2766-427A-80A9-E5134DEE2340">
      So we stayed where we was. <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_the_duke">The duke</rs> he fretted and sweated around,
      and was in a mighty sour way. He scolded us for everything, and we
      couldn't seem to do nothing right; he found fault with every little thing.
      Something was a-brewing, sure. I was good and glad when midday come
      and no king; we could have a change, anyway—and maybe a chance for
      <hi rend="italics">the</hi> change on top of it. So me and <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_the_duke">the duke</rs> went up to the village,
      and hunted around there for the king, and by and by we found him in the
      back room of a little low doggery, very tight, and a lot of loafers
      bullyragging him for sport, and he a-cussing and a-threatening with all
      his might, and so tight he couldn't walk, and couldn't do nothing to them.
      <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_the_duke">The duke</rs> he begun to abuse him for an old fool, and the king begun
      to sass back, and the minute they was fairly at it I lit out and shook the
      reefs out of my hind legs, and spun down the river road like a deer, for I
      see our chance; and I made up my mind that it would be a long day before
      they ever see me and <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> again. I got down there all out of breath
      but loaded up with joy, and sung out:
    </p>
   <p xml:id="78E92415-6AFE-4FD8-96BB-B5EAFEC63FA3">
      "Set her loose, Jim! we're all right now!"
    </p>
   <p xml:id="5884CBDE-ED19-47B1-955C-36B1EE890085">
      But there warn't no answer, and nobody come out of the wigwam. Jim
      was gone! I set up a shout—and then another—and then
      another one; and run this way and that in the woods, whooping and
      screeching; but it warn't no use—old <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> was gone. Then I set
      down and cried; I couldn't help it. But I couldn't set still long. Pretty
      soon I went out on the road, trying to think what I better do, and I run
      across a boy walking, and asked him if he'd seen a strange nigger dressed
      so and so, and he says:

      I didn't have none, so he left. I went to the raft, and set down in
      the wigwam to think. But I couldn't come to nothing. I thought
      till I wore my head sore, but I couldn't see no way out of the trouble.
      After all this long journey, and after all we'd done for them
      scoundrels, here it was all come to nothing, everything all busted up and
      ruined, because they could have the heart to serve <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> such a trick as
      that, and make him a slave again all his life, and amongst strangers, too,
      for forty dirty dollars.
    </p>
   <p xml:id="4194EEAF-099A-4E79-AD5C-E6B031D1F52E">
      Once I said to myself it would be a thousand times better for <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> to be a
      slave at home where his family was, as long as he'd <hi rend="italics">got</hi> to be a slave, and
      so I'd better write a letter to <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom Sawyer</rs>and tell him to tell <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_miss_watson">Miss Watson</rs> where he was. But I soon give up that notion for two things:
      she'd be mad and disgusted at his rascality and ungratefulness for leaving
      her, and so she'd sell him straight down the river again; and if she
      didn't, everybody naturally despises an ungrateful nigger, and they'd make
      <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> feel it all the time, and so he'd feel ornery and disgraced. And then
      think of <hi rend="italics">me</hi>! It would get all around that Huck Finn helped a nigger
      to get his freedom; and if I was ever to see anybody from that town again
      I'd be ready to get down and lick his boots for shame. That's just
      the way: a person does a low-down thing, and then he don't want to
      take no consequences of it. Thinks as long as he can hide it, it ain't no
      disgrace. That was my fix exactly. The more I studied about this the
      more my conscience went to grinding me, and the more wicked and low-down
      and ornery I got to feeling. And at last, when it hit me all of a sudden
      that here was the plain hand of Providence slapping me in the face and
      letting me know my wickedness was being watched all the time from up there
      in heaven, whilst I was stealing a poor old woman's nigger that hadn't
      ever done me no harm, and now was showing me there's One that's always on
      the lookout, and ain't a-going to allow no such miserable doings to go
      only just so fur and no further, I most dropped in my tracks I was so
      scared. Well, I tried the best I could to kinder soften it up
      somehow for myself by saying I was brung up wicked, and so I warn't so
      much to blame; but something inside of me kept saying, "There was the
      Sunday-school, you could a gone to it; and if you'd a done it they'd a
      learnt you there that people that acts as I'd been acting about that
      nigger goes to everlasting fire."
    </p>
   <p xml:id="7602D64A-A718-4DFB-A654-D50EDAA51FA0">
      It made me shiver. And I about made up my mind to pray, and see if I
      couldn't try to quit being the kind of a boy I was and be better. So
      I kneeled down. But the words wouldn't come. Why wouldn't
      they? It warn't no use to try and hide it from Him. Nor from
      <hi rend="italics">me</hi>, neither. I knowed very well why they wouldn't come. It was
      because my heart warn't right; it was because I warn't square; it was
      because I was playing double. I was letting <hi rend="italics">on</hi> to give up sin, but
      away inside of me I was holding on to the biggest one of all. I was
      trying to make my mouth <hi rend="italics">say</hi> I would do the right thing and the clean
      thing, and go and write to that nigger's owner and tell where he was; but
      deep down in me I knowed it was a lie, and He knowed it. You can't
      pray a lie—I found that out.

   <p xml:id="762890E0-2924-47B3-8281-04A23141DD07">
      So I was full of trouble, full as I could be; and didn't know what to do.
      At last I had an idea; and I says, I'll go and write the letter—and
      then see if I can pray. Why, it was astonishing, the way I felt as
      light as a feather right straight off, and my troubles all gone. So
      I got a piece of paper and a pencil, all glad and excited, and set down
      and wrote:

      I felt good and all washed clean of sin for the first time I had ever felt
      so in my life, and I knowed I could pray now. But I didn't do it
      straight off, but laid the paper down and set there thinking—thinking
      how good it was all this happened so, and how near I come to being lost
      and going to hell. And went on thinking. And got to thinking
      over our trip down the river; and I see <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> before me all the time: in
      the day and in the night-time, sometimes moonlight, sometimes storms, and
      we a-floating along, talking and singing and laughing. But somehow I
      couldn't seem to strike no places to harden me against him, but only the
      other kind. I'd see him standing my watch on top of his'n, 'stead of
      calling me, so I could go on sleeping; and see him how glad he was when I
      come back out of the fog; and when I come to him again in the swamp, up
      there where the feud was; and such-like times; and would always call me
      honey, and pet me and do everything he could think of for me, and how good
      he always was; and at last I struck the time I saved him by telling the
      men we had small-pox aboard, and he was so grateful, and said I was the
      best friend old <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> ever had in the world, and the <hi rend="italics">only</hi> one he's got now;
      and then I happened to look around and see that paper.
    </p>
   <p xml:id="3B393355-EF9B-4892-884A-D6606317D096">
      It was a close place. I took it up, and held it in my hand. I
      was a-trembling, because I'd got to decide, forever, betwixt two things,
      and I knowed it. I studied a minute, sort of holding my breath, and
      then says to myself:
    </p>
   <p xml:id="1BFE18A1-5CFD-447B-9A72-F063793E5F51">
      "All right, then, I'll <hi rend="italics">go</hi> to hell"—and tore it up.

   <p xml:id="60F7D9DE-2207-4136-9984-934EF9EC0BC4">
      It was awful thoughts and awful words, but they was said. And I let
      them stay said; and never thought no more about reforming. I shoved
      the whole thing out of my head, and said I would take up wickedness again,
      which was in my line, being brung up to it, and the other warn't. And
      for a starter I would go to work and steal <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> out of slavery again; and
      if I could think up anything worse, I would do that, too; because as long
      as I was in, and in for good, I might as well go the whole hog.

   <p xml:id="20C8D462-4C66-4D1E-80D2-400F52EABC3C">
      Then I set to thinking over how to get at it, and turned over some
      considerable many ways in my mind; and at last fixed up a plan that suited
      me. So then I took the bearings of a woody island that was down the
      river a piece, and as soon as it was fairly dark I crept out with my raft
      and went for it, and hid it there, and then turned in. I slept the
      night through, and got up before it was light, and had my breakfast, and
      put on my store clothes, and tied up some others and one thing or another
      in a bundle, and took the canoe and cleared for shore. I landed
      below where I judged was Phelps's place, and hid my bundle in the woods,
      and then filled up the canoe with water, and loaded rocks into her and
      sunk her where I could find her again when I wanted her, about a quarter
      of a mile below a little steam sawmill that was on the bank.

   <p xml:id="84247DBB-D44B-4F4D-8920-F08C3CE52F6E">
      Then I struck up the road, and when I passed the mill I see a sign on it,
      "Phelps's Sawmill," and when I come to the farm-houses, two or three
      hundred yards further along, I kept my eyes peeled, but didn't see nobody
      around, though it was good daylight now. But I didn't mind, because
      I didn't want to see nobody just yet—I only wanted to get the lay of
      the land. According to my plan, I was going to turn up there from the
      village, not from below. So I just took a look, and shoved along,
      straight for town. Well, the very first man I see when I got there was <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_the_duke">the duke</rs>. He was sticking up a bill for the Royal Nonesuch—three-night
      performance—like that other time. They had the cheek, them

      "Hel-<hi rend="italics">lo</hi>! Where'd <hi rend="italics">you</hi> come from?" Then he says, kind of glad

      "Well," I says, "when I see the king in that doggery yesterday I says to
      myself, we can't get him home for hours, till he's soberer; so I went
      a-loafing around town to put in the time and wait. A man up and
      offered me ten cents to help him pull a skiff over the river and back to
      fetch a sheep, and so I went along; but when we was dragging him to the

      him along, he was too strong for me and jerked loose and run, and we after
      him. We didn't have no dog, and so we had to chase him all over the
      country till we tired him out. We never got him till dark; then we
      fetched him over, and I started down for the raft. When I got there
      and see it was gone, I says to myself, 'They've got into trouble and had
      to leave; and they've took my nigger, which is the only nigger I've got in
      the world, and now I'm in a strange country, and ain't got no property no
      more, nor nothing, and no way to make my living;' so I set down and cried.

      raft, then?—and Jim—poor Jim!"

      but what he'd spent for whisky; and when I got him home late last night

      and shook us, and run off down the river.'"

      Phelps' was one of these little one-horse cotton plantations, and they all
      look alike. A rail fence round a two-acre yard; a stile made out of
      logs sawed off and up-ended in steps, like barrels of a different length,
      to climb over the fence with, and for the women to stand on when they are
      going to jump on to a horse; some sickly grass-patches in the big yard,
      but mostly it was bare and smooth, like an old hat with the nap rubbed
      off; big double log-house for the white folks—hewed logs, with the
      chinks stopped up with mud or mortar, and these mud-stripes been
      whitewashed some time or another; round-log kitchen, with a big broad,
      open but roofed passage joining it to the house; log smoke-house back of
      the kitchen; three little log nigger-cabins in a row t'other side the
      smoke-house; one little hut all by itself away down against the back
      fence, and some outbuildings down a piece the other side; ash-hopper and
      big kettle to bile soap in by the little hut; bench by the kitchen door,
      with bucket of water and a gourd; hound asleep there in the sun; more
      hounds asleep round about; about three shade trees away off in a corner;
      some currant bushes and gooseberry bushes in one place by the fence;
      outside of the fence a garden and a watermelon patch; then the cotton

      I went around and clumb over the back stile by the ash-hopper, and started
      for the kitchen. When I got a little ways I heard the dim hum of a

      knowed for certain I wished I was dead—for that <hi rend="italics">is</hi> the lonesomest
      sound in the whole world.

      I went right along, not fixing up any particular plan, but just trusting
      to Providence to put the right words in my mouth when the time come; for

      When I got half-way, first one hound and then another got up and went for

      another powwow as they made! In a quarter of a minute I was a kind
      of a hub of a wheel, as you may say—spokes made out of dogs—circle
      of fifteen of them packed together around me, with their necks and noses
      stretched up towards me, a-barking and howling; and more a-coming; you
      could see them sailing over fences and around corners from everywheres.

      without anything on but tow-linen shirts, and they hung on to their

      always do. And here comes the white woman running from the house,
      about forty-five or fifty year old, bareheaded, and her spinning-stick in
      her hand; and behind her comes her little white children, acting the same

      I was getting so uneasy I couldn't listen good. I had my mind on the
      children all the time; I wanted to get them out to one side and pump them
      a little, and find out who I was. But I couldn't get no show, Mrs.
      Phelps kept it up and run on so. Pretty soon she made the cold
      chills streak all down my back, because she says:

      "But here we're a-running on this way, and you hain't told me a word about

      Well, I see I was up a stump—and up it good. Providence had
      stood by me this fur all right, but I was hard and tight aground now.
      I see it warn't a bit of use to try to go ahead—I'd got to
      throw up my hand. So I says to myself, here's another place where I
      got to resk the truth. I opened my mouth to begin; but she grabbed
      me and hustled me in behind the bed, and says:

      He sprung to the window at the head of the bed, and that give Mrs. Phelps

      But if they was joyful, it warn't nothing to what I was; for it was like

      froze to me for two hours; and at last, when my chin was so tired it
      couldn't hardly go any more, I had told them more about my family—I
      mean the Sawyer family—than ever happened to any six Sawyer
      families. And I explained all about how we blowed out a
      cylinder-head at the mouth of White River, and it took us three days to
      fix it. Which was all right, and worked first-rate; because <hi rend="italics">they</hi>

      the plantation, which he built it himself at his own expense, for a church
      and schoolhouse, and never charged nothing for his preaching, and it was
      worth it, too. There was plenty other farmer-preachers like that,
      and done the same way, down South.

      We had dinner out in that broad open passage betwixt the house and the
      kitchen; and there was things enough on that table for seven families—and
      all hot, too; none of your flabby, tough meat that's laid in a cupboard in
      a damp cellar all night and tastes like a hunk of old cold cannibal in the
      morning. Uncle Silas he asked a pretty long blessing over it, but it
      was worth it; and it didn't cool it a bit, neither, the way I've seen them
      kind of interruptions do lots of times. There was a considerable
      good deal of talk all the afternoon, and me and Tom was on the lookout all
      the time; but it warn't no use, they didn't happen to say nothing about
      any runaway nigger, and we was afraid to try to work up to it. But
      at supper, at night, one of the little boys says:
    </p>
   <p xml:id="956955EF-8E64-431D-A45D-B62B1558EA1F">
      "Pa, mayn't Tom and Sid and me go to the show?"

      "No," says the old man, "I <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckon</orig><reg>think</reg></choice></distinct> there ain't going to be any; and you
      couldn't go if there was; because the runaway nigger told Burton and me

      So there it was!—but I couldn't help it. Tom and me was to
      sleep in the same room and bed; so, being tired, we bid good-night and
      went up to bed right after supper, and clumb out of the window and down
      the lightning-rod, and shoved for the town; for I didn't believe anybody
      was going to give the king and <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_the_duke">the duke</rs> a hint, and so if I didn't hurry
      up and give them one they'd get into trouble sure.

      and how pap disappeared pretty soon, and didn't come back no more, and
      what a stir there was when <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> run away; and I told Tom all about our
      Royal Nonesuch rapscallions, and as much of the raft voyage as I had time
      to; and as we struck into the town and up through the the middle of it--it
      was as much as half-after eight, then—here comes a raging rush of
      people with torches, and an awful whooping and yelling, and banging tin
      pans and blowing horns; and we jumped to one side to let them go by; and
      as they went by I see they had the king and <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_the_duke">the duke</rs> astraddle of a rail—that
      is, I knowed it <hi rend="italics">was</hi> the king and the duke, though they was all over tar
      and feathers, and didn't look like nothing in the world that was human—just
      looked like a couple of monstrous big soldier-plumes. Well, it made
      me sick to see it; and I was sorry for them poor pitiful rascals, it
      seemed like I couldn't ever feel any hardness against them any more in the
      world. It was a dreadful thing to see. Human beings <hi rend="italics">can</hi> be

      We see we was too late—couldn't do no good. We asked some
      stragglers about it, and they said everybody went to the show looking very

      middle of his cavortings on the stage; then somebody give a signal, and
      the house rose up and went for them.

      So we poked along back home, and I warn't feeling so brash as I was
      before, but kind of ornery, and humble, and to blame, somehow—though

      difference whether you do right or wrong, a person's conscience ain't got
      no sense, and just goes for him anyway. If I had a yaller dog that

      Well, one thing was dead sure, and that was that <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom Sawyer</rs>was in

      That was the thing that was too many for me. Here was a boy that was
      respectable and well brung up; and had a character to lose; and folks at
      home that had characters; and he was bright and not leather-headed; and
      knowing and not ignorant; and not mean, but kind; and yet here he was,
      without any more pride, or rightness, or feeling, than to stoop to this
      business, and make himself a shame, and his family a shame, before
      everybody. I <hi rend="italics">couldn't</hi> understand it no way at all. It was
      outrageous, and I knowed I ought to just up and tell him so; and so be his
      true friend, and let him quit the thing right where he was and save

      Betwixt the hut and the fence, on the back side, was a lean-to that joined
      the hut at the eaves, and was made out of plank. It was as long as

      was at the south end, and was padlocked. <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom</rs> e went to the
      soap-kettle and searched around, and fetched back the iron thing they lift
      the lid with; so he took it and prized out one of the staples. The
      chain fell down, and we opened the door and went in, and shut it, and
      struck a match, and see the shed was only built against a cabin and hadn't
      no connection with it; and there warn't no floor to the shed, nor nothing
      in it but some old rusty played-out hoes and spades and picks and a
      crippled plow. The match went out, and so did we, and shoved in the
      staple again, and the door was locked as good as ever. Tom was joyful.

      read any books at all?—Baron Trenck, nor Casanova, nor Benvenuto

      getting a prisoner loose in such an old-maidy way as that? No; the
      way all the best authorities does is to saw the bed-leg in two, and leave
      it just so, and swallow the sawdust, so it can't be found, and put some
      dirt and grease around the sawed place so the very keenest seneskal can't
      see no sign of it's being sawed, and thinks the bed-leg is perfectly
      sound. Then, the night you're ready, fetch the leg a kick, down she goes;
      slip off your chain, and there you are. Nothing to do but hitch your
      rope ladder to the battlements, shin down it, break your leg in the moat—because
      a rope ladder is nineteen foot too short, you know—and there's your
      horses and your trusty vassles, and they scoop you up and fling you across
      a saddle, and away you go to your native Langudoc, or Navarre, or wherever
      it is. It's gaudy, Huck. I wish there was a moat to this cabin. If
      we get time, the night of the escape, we'll dig one."

      Along during the morning I borrowed a sheet and a white shirt off of the
      clothes-line; and I found an old sack and put them in it, and we went down
      and got the fox-fire, and put that in too. I called it borrowing,
      because that was what pap always called it; but <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom</rs> aid it warn't
      borrowing, it was stealing. He said we was representing prisoners;
      and prisoners don't care how they get a thing so they get it, and nobody
      don't blame them for it, either. It ain't no crime in a prisoner to
      steal the thing he needs to get away with, <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom</rs> aid; it's his right; and
      so, as long as we was representing a prisoner, we had a perfect right to
      steal anything on this place we had the least use for to get ourselves out
      of prison with. He said if we warn't prisoners it would be a very
      different thing, and nobody but a mean, ornery person would steal when he
      warn't a prisoner. So we allowed we would steal everything there was
      that come handy. And yet he made a mighty fuss, one day, after that,
      when I stole a watermelon out of the nigger-patch and eat it; and he made
      me go and give the niggers a dime without telling them what it was for.
      <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom</rs> aid that what he meant was, we could steal anything we <hi rend="italics">needed</hi>. Well,
      I says, I needed the watermelon. But he said I didn't need it to get
      out of prison with; there's where the difference was. He said if I'd
      a wanted it to hide a knife in, and smuggle it to <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> to kill the seneskal
      with, it would a been all right. So I let it go at that, though I
      couldn't see no advantage in my representing a prisoner if I got to set
      down and chaw over a lot of gold-leaf distinctions like that every time I
      see a chance to hog a watermelon.

      hole there, because Jim's counter-pin hung down most to the ground, and
      you'd have to raise it up and look under to see the hole. So we dug
      and dug with the case-knives till most midnight; and then we was

      they was changing watches, and so our hands wouldn't get blistered, and we

      Next day <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom</rs> tole a pewter spoon and a brass candlestick in the house,
      for to make some pens for <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> out of, and six tallow candles; and I hung
      around the nigger cabins and laid for a chance, and stole three tin

      and jimpson weeds under the window-hole—then we could tote them back
      and he could use them over again. So Tom was satisfied. Then

   <p xml:id="9DE3CE6D-9DB3-4CF0-9A66-CAABE3316619">
      "Now, the thing to study out is, how to get the things to <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs>."

      He only just looked scornful, and said something about nobody ever heard
      of such an idiotic idea, and then he went to studying. By and by he
      said he had ciphered out two or three ways, but there warn't no need to
      decide on any of them yet. Said we'd got to post <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> first.
    </p>
   <p xml:id="1B593C68-8461-4598-92DA-71E51AFEEB8A">
      That night we went down the lightning-rod a little after ten, and took one
      of the candles along, and listened under the window-hole, and heard Jim
      snoring; so we pitched it in, and it didn't wake him. Then we
      whirled in with the pick and shovel, and in about two hours and a half the
      job was done. We crept in under Jim's bed and into the cabin, and
      pawed around and found the candle and lit it, and stood over <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> awhile,
      and found him looking hearty and healthy, and then we woke him up gentle
      and gradual. He was so glad to see us he most cried; and called us
      honey, and all the pet names he could think of; and was for having us hunt
      up a cold-chisel to cut the chain off of his leg with right away, and
      clearing out without losing any time. But <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom</rs> e showed him how
      unregular it would be, and set down and told him all about our plans, and
      how we could alter them in a minute any time there was an alarm; and not
      to be the least afraid, because we would see he got away, <hi rend="italics">sure</hi>. So
      Jim he said it was all right, and we set there and talked over old times
      awhile, and then Tom asked a lot of questions, and when Jim told him Uncle
      Silas come in every day or two to pray with him, and Aunt Sally come in to
      see if he was comfortable and had plenty to eat, and both of them was kind
      as they could be, <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom</rs> ays:

      "<hi rend="italics">Now</hi> I know how to fix it. We'll send you some things by them."
    </p>
   <p xml:id="78153053-7EC9-4274-9BEA-1A6C62F33BFC">
      I said, "Don't do nothing of the kind; it's one of the most jackass ideas
      I ever struck;" but he never paid no attention to me; went right on.
      It was his way when he'd got his plans set.
    </p>
   <p xml:id="119C20DE-4C23-4F54-8F77-5393539EA4D7">
      So he told <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> how we'd have to smuggle in the rope-ladder pie and other
      large things by Nat, the nigger that fed him, and he must be on the
      lookout, and not be surprised, and not let Nat see him open them; and we
      would put small things in uncle's coat-pockets and he must steal them out;
      and we would tie things to aunt's apron-strings or put them in her
      apron-pocket, if we got a chance; and told him what they would be and what
      they was for. And told him how to keep a journal on the shirt with
      his blood, and all that. He told him everything. <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> he couldn't see
      no sense in the most of it, but he allowed we was white folks and knowed
      better than him; so he was satisfied, and said he would do it all just as

   <p xml:id="C066AFC0-ED08-4A34-8783-32ADDCF282DE">
      <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> had plenty corn-cob pipes and tobacco; so we had a right down good
      sociable time; then we crawled out through the hole, and so home to bed,
      with hands that looked like they'd been chawed. Tom was in high
      spirits. He said it was the best fun he ever had in his life, and the most
      intellectural; and said if he only could see his way to it we would keep
      it up all the rest of our lives and leave <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> to our children to get out;
      for he believed <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> would come to like it better and better the more he
      got used to it. He said that in that way it could be strung out to
      as much as eighty year, and would be the best time on record. And he
      said it would make us all celebrated that had a hand in it.
    </p>
   <p xml:id="0BA85673-A964-4C96-8107-34EAE76AA6B4">
      In the morning we went out to the woodpile and chopped up the brass
      candlestick into handy sizes, and <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom</rs> ut them and the pewter spoon in his
      pocket. Then we went to the nigger cabins, and while I got Nat's
      notice off, <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom</rs> hoved a piece of candlestick into the middle of a corn-pone
      that was in Jim's pan, and we went along with Nat to see how it would
      work, and it just worked noble; when <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> bit into it it most mashed all
      his teeth out; and there warn't ever anything could a worked better. Tom
      said so himself. <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> he never let on but what it was only just a piece of
      rock or something like that that's always getting into bread, you know;
      but after that he never bit into nothing but what he jabbed his fork into
      it in three or four places first.

   <p xml:id="4785CAC8-1580-4684-A8B2-99131A1AAB9A">
      And whilst we was a-standing there in the dimmish light, here comes a
      couple of the hounds bulging in from under Jim's bed; and they kept on
      piling in till there was eleven of them, and there warn't hardly room in
      there to get your breath. By jings, we forgot to fasten that lean-to
      door! The nigger Nat he only just hollered "Witches" once, and
      keeled over on to the floor amongst the dogs, and begun to groan like he
      was dying. <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom</rs> erked the door open and flung out a slab of Jim's
      meat, and the dogs went for it, and in two seconds he was out himself and
      back again and shut the door, and I knowed he'd fixed the other door too.
      Then he went to work on the nigger, coaxing him and petting him, and
      asking him if he'd been imagining he saw something again. He raised
      up, and blinked his eyes around, and says:

      THAT was all fixed. So then we went away and went to the
      rubbage-pile in the back yard, where they keep the old boots, and rags,
      and pieces of bottles, and wore-out tin things, and all such truck, and
      scratched around and found an old tin washpan, and stopped up the holes as
      well as we could, to bake the pie in, and took it down cellar and stole it
      full of flour and started for breakfast, and found a couple of
      shingle-nails that <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom</rs> aid would be handy for a prisoner to scrabble his
      name and sorrows on the dungeon walls with, and dropped one of them in
      Aunt Sally's apron-pocket which was hanging on a chair, and t'other we
      stuck in the band of Uncle Silas's hat, which was on the bureau, because
      we heard the children say their pa and ma was going to the runaway
      nigger's house this morning, and then went to breakfast, and <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom</rs> ropped
      the pewter spoon in Uncle Silas's coat-pocket, and Aunt Sally wasn't come
      yet, so we had to wait a little while.

      My heart fell down amongst my lungs and livers and things, and a hard
      piece of corn-crust started down my throat after it and got met on the

      mooning around, first to one rat-hole and then another, till he'd been to

      But she counted and counted till she got that addled she'd start to

      out right, and three times they come out wrong. Then she grabbed up

      But that pie was a job; we had no end of trouble with that pie. We
      fixed it up away down in the woods, and cooked it there; and we got it
      done at last, and very satisfactory, too; but not all in one day; and we
      had to use up three wash-pans full of flour before we got through, and we
      got burnt pretty much all over, in places, and eyes put out with the
      smoke; because, you see, we didn't want nothing but a crust, and we
      couldn't prop it up right, and she would always cave in. But of
      course we thought of the right way at last—which was to cook the
      ladder, too, in the pie. So then we laid in with <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> the second
      night, and tore up the sheet all in little strings and twisted them
      together, and long before daylight we had a lovely rope that you could a

      And in the forenoon we took it down to the woods, but it wouldn't go into
      the pie. Being made of a whole sheet, that way, there was rope
      enough for forty pies if we'd a wanted them, and plenty left over for
      soup, or sausage, or anything you choose. We could a had a whole

      and so we throwed the rest away. We didn't cook none of the pies in

      belonged to one of his ancesters with a long wooden handle that come over
      from England with William the Conqueror in the Mayflower or one of them

      things that was valuable, not on account of being any account, because
      they warn't, but on account of them being relicts, you know, and we snaked
      her out, private, and took her down there, but she failed on the first
      pies, because we didn't know how, but she come up smiling on the last one.
      We took and lined her with dough, and set her in the coals, and
      loaded her up with rag rope, and put on a dough roof, and shut down the
      lid, and put hot embers on top, and stood off five foot, with the long
      handle, cool and comfortable, and in fifteen minutes she turned out a pie
      that was a satisfaction to look at. But the person that et it would want
      to fetch a couple of kags of toothpicks along, for if that rope ladder
      wouldn't cramp him down to business I don't know nothing what I'm talking
      about, and lay him in enough stomach-ache to last him till next time, too.

      IN the morning we went up to the village and bought a wire rat-trap and
      fetched it down, and unstopped the best rat-hole, and in about an hour we
      had fifteen of the bulliest kind of ones; and then we took it and put it
      in a safe place under Aunt Sally's bed. But while we was gone for
      spiders little Thomas Franklin Benjamin Jefferson Elexander Phelps found
      it there, and opened the door of it to see if the rats would come out, and
      they did; and Aunt Sally she come in, and when we got back she was
      a-standing on top of the bed raising Cain, and the rats was doing what
      they could to keep off the dull times for her. So she took and
      dusted us both with the hickry, and we was as much as two hours catching
      another fifteen or sixteen, drat that meddlesome cub, and they warn't the
      likeliest, nuther, because the first haul was the pick of the flock.
      I never see a likelier lot of rats than what that first haul was.

      We got a splendid stock of sorted spiders, and bugs, and frogs, and
      caterpillars, and one thing or another; and we like to got a hornet's
      nest, but we didn't. The family was at home. We didn't give it
      right up, but stayed with them as long as we could; because we allowed
      we'd tire them out or they'd got to tire us out, and they done it. Then
      we got allycumpain and rubbed on the places, and was pretty near all right
      again, but couldn't set down convenient. And so we went for the
      snakes, and grabbed a couple of dozen garters and house-snakes, and put
      them in a bag, and put it in our room, and by that time it was
      supper-time, and a rattling good honest day's work: and hungry?—oh,
      no, I <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckon</orig><reg>think</reg></choice></distinct> not! And there warn't a blessed snake up there when we
      went back—we didn't half tie the sack, and they worked out somehow,
      and left. But it didn't matter much, because they was still on the
      premises somewheres. So we judged we could get some of them again.
      No, there warn't no real scarcity of snakes about the house for a
      considerable spell. You'd see them dripping from the rafters and
      places every now and then; and they generly landed in your plate, or down
      the back of your neck, and most of the time where you didn't want them.
      Well, they was handsome and striped, and there warn't no harm in a
      million of them; but that never made no difference to Aunt Sally; she
      despised snakes, be the breed what they might, and she couldn't stand them
      no way you could fix it; and every time one of them flopped down on her,
      it didn't make no difference what she was doing, she would just lay that
      work down and light out. I never see such a woman. And you
      could hear her whoop to Jericho. You couldn't get her to take a-holt
      of one of them with the tongs. And if she turned over and found one
      in bed she would scramble out and lift a howl that you would think the
      house was afire. She disturbed the old man so that he said he could
      most wish there hadn't ever been no snakes created. Why, after every
      last snake had been gone clear out of the house for as much as a week Aunt
      Sally warn't over it yet; she warn't near over it; when she was setting
      thinking about something you could touch her on the back of her neck with
      a feather and she would jump right out of her stockings. It was very
      curious. But <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom</rs> aid all women was just so. He said they was
      made that way for some reason or other.

      We got a licking every time one of our snakes come in her way, and she
      allowed these lickings warn't nothing to what she would do if we ever
      loaded up the place again with them. I didn't mind the lickings,
      because they didn't amount to nothing; but I minded the trouble we had to
      lay in another lot. But we got them laid in, and all the other
      things; and you never see a cabin as blithesome as Jim's was when they'd
      all swarm out for music and go for him. <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> didn't like the spiders,
      and the spiders didn't like Jim; and so they'd lay for him, and make it
      mighty warm for him. And he said that between the rats and the
      snakes and the grindstone there warn't no room in bed for him, skasely;
      and when there was, <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>a body</orig><reg>somebody</reg></choice></distinct> couldn't sleep, it was so lively, and it was
      always lively, he said, because <hi rend="italics">they</hi> never all slept at one time, but took
      turn about, so when the snakes was asleep the rats was on deck, and when
      the rats turned in the snakes come on watch, so he always had one gang
      under him, in his way, and t'other gang having a circus over him, and if
      he got up to hunt a new place the spiders would take a chance at him as he
      crossed over. He said if he ever got out this time he wouldn't ever be a
      prisoner again, not for a salary.

      Well, by the end of three weeks everything was in pretty good shape.
      The shirt was sent in early, in a pie, and every time a rat bit Jim
      he would get up and write a little in his journal whilst the ink was
      fresh; the pens was made, the inscriptions and so on was all carved on the
      grindstone; the bed-leg was sawed in two, and we had et up the sawdust,
      and it give us a most amazing stomach-ache. We <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckoned</orig><reg>thought</reg></choice></distinct> we was all

      again; and she was afraid to go to bed, but she dasn't set up. So
      the thing was working very well, <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom</rs> aid; he said he never see a thing
      work more satisfactory. He said it showed it was done right.
    </p>
   <p xml:id="9535AD88-053B-4705-9E51-094B08E8BA79">
      So he said, now for the grand bulge! So the very next morning at the
      streak of dawn we got another letter ready, and was wondering what we
      better do with it, because we heard them say at supper they was going to
      have a nigger on watch at both doors all night. <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom</rs> e went down the
      lightning-rod to spy around; and the nigger at the back door was asleep,
      and he stuck it in the back of his neck and come back. This letter
      said:
    </p>
   <p xml:id="E5662E60-0A22-4F7E-AA4F-5E56013D9E41">
      Don't betray me, I wish to be your friend. There is a desprate gang
      of cutthroats from over in the Indian Territory going to steal your
      runaway nigger to-night, and they have been trying to scare you so as you
      will stay in the house and not bother them. I am one of the gang,
      but have got religgion and wish to quit it and lead an honest life again,
      and will betray the helish design. They will sneak down from northards,
      along the fence, at midnight exact, with a false key, and go in the
      nigger's cabin to get him. I am to be off a piece and blow a tin horn if I
      see any danger; but stead of that I will <hi rend="italics">baa</hi> like a sheep soon as they get
      in and not blow at all; then whilst they are getting his chains loose, you
      slip there and lock them in, and can kill them at your leasure. Don't
      do anything but just the way I am telling you, if you do they will
      suspicion something and raise whoop-jamboreehoo. I do not wish any reward
      but to know I have done the right thing. <hi rend="italics">Unknown Friend.</hi>

      WE was feeling pretty good after breakfast, and took my canoe and went
      over the river a-fishing, with a lunch, and had a good time, and took a
      look at the raft and found her all right, and got home late to supper, and
      found them in such a sweat and worry they didn't know which end they was
      standing on, and made us go right off to bed the minute we was done
      supper, and wouldn't tell us what the trouble was, and never let on a word
      about the new letter, but didn't need to, because we knowed as much about
      it as anybody did, and as soon as we was half up stairs and her back was
      turned we slid for the cellar cupboard and loaded up a good lunch and took
      it up to our room and went to bed, and got up about half-past eleven, and
      <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom</rs> ut on Aunt Sally's dress that he stole and was going to start with
      the lunch, but says:

   <p xml:id="E5066F0D-69BF-4E91-A70F-AD9AB8A3C2F3">
      "We can get along <hi rend="italics">with</hi> it, too," he says; "just you slide down cellar and
      fetch it. And then mosey right down the lightning-rod and come
      along. I'll go and stuff the straw into Jim's clothes to represent his
      mother in disguise, and be ready to <hi rend="italics">baa</hi> like a sheep and shove soon as you

   <p xml:id="48CA0BA7-CFC8-4C46-A22F-73BC3042C546">
      So out he went, and down cellar went I. The hunk of butter, big as a
      person's fist, was where I had left it, so I took up the slab of corn-pone
      with it on, and blowed out my light, and started up stairs very
      stealthy, and got up to the main floor all right, but here comes Aunt
      Sally with a candle, and I clapped the truck in my hat, and clapped my hat
      on my head, and the next second she see me; and she says:

      s'pose there was so many strange things going on she was just in a sweat
      about every little thing that warn't yard-stick straight; so she says,
      very decided:
    </p>
   <p xml:id="2F486020-018F-4B09-ACE9-77CF49A09695">
      "You just march into that setting-room and stay there till I come. You

   <p xml:id="4007CE1B-2310-4481-8FAF-8FF4D8D019F3">
      So she went away as I opened the door and walked into the setting-room.
      My, but there was a crowd there! Fifteen farmers, and every one of
      them had a gun. I was most powerful sick, and slunk to a chair and
      set down. They was setting around, some of them talking a little, in a low
      voice, and all of them fidgety and uneasy, but trying to look like they
      warn't; but I knowed they was, because they was always taking off their
      hats, and putting them on, and scratching their heads, and changing their
      seats, and fumbling with their buttons. I warn't easy myself, but I
      didn't take my hat off, all the same.

      I did wish Aunt Sally would come, and get done with me, and lick me, if

      At last she come and begun to ask me questions, but I <hi rend="italics">couldn't</hi> answer them
      straight, I didn't know which end of me was up; because these men was in
      such a fidget now that some was wanting to start right NOW and lay for
      them desperadoes, and saying it warn't but a few minutes to midnight; and
      others was trying to get them to hold on and wait for the sheep-signal;
      and here was Aunty pegging away at the questions, and me a-shaking all
      over and ready to sink down in my tracks I was that scared; and the place
      getting hotter and hotter, and the butter beginning to melt and run down
      my neck and behind my ears; and pretty soon, when one of them says, "I'M
      for going and getting in the cabin <hi rend="italics">first</hi> and right <hi rend="italics">now</hi>, and catching them
      when they come," I most dropped; and a streak of butter come a-trickling
      down my forehead, and Aunt Sally she see it, and turns white as a sheet,
      and says:

      And everybody runs to see, and she snatches off my hat, and out comes the

   <p xml:id="3EB03996-18EC-4220-80CF-BE1B293C0135">
      "Oh, what a turn you did give me! and how glad and grateful I am it ain't
      no worse; for luck's against us, and it never rains but it pours, and when
      I see that truck I thought we'd lost you, for I knowed by the color and

      I was up stairs in a second, and down the lightning-rod in another one,
      and shinning through the dark for the lean-to. I couldn't hardly get
      my words out, I was so anxious; but I told Tom as quick as I could we must
      jump for it now, and not a minute to lose—the house full of men,
      yonder, with guns!

   <p xml:id="8FAEAD85-1623-4AF2-9F7D-9AD792F09110">

      "No!—is that so? <hi rend="italics">ain't</hi> it bully! Why, Huck, if it was to

      But then we heard the tramp of men coming to the door, and heard them

   <p xml:id="C91B3B36-1CA0-474C-B9C1-6A02601CDEA0">
      "I <hi rend="italics">told</hi> you we'd be too soon; they haven't come—the door is locked.
      Here, I'll lock some of you into the cabin, and you lay for 'em in the

      So in they come, but couldn't see us in the dark, and most trod on us
      whilst we was hustling to get under the bed. But we got under all
      right, and out through the hole, swift but soft—<rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> first, me next,
      and <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom</rs> ast, which was according to Tom's orders. Now we was in the
      lean-to, and heard trampings close by outside. So we crept to the
      door, and <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom</rs> topped us there and put his eye to the crack, but couldn't
      make out nothing, it was so dark; and whispered and said he would listen
      for the steps to get further, and when he nudged us <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> must glide out
      first, and him last. So he set his ear to the crack and listened,
      and listened, and listened, and the steps a-scraping around out there all
      the time; and at last he nudged us, and we slid out, and stooped down, not
      breathing, and not making the least noise, and slipped stealthy towards
      the fence in Injun file, and got to it all right, and me and <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> over it;
      but Tom's britches catched fast on a splinter on the top rail, and then he
      hear the steps coming, so he had to pull loose, which snapped the splinter
      and made a noise; and as he dropped in our tracks and started somebody
      sings out:

    </p>
   <p xml:id="8AB60974-F890-43E6-ADE0-45CC8549CC90">
      But we didn't answer; we just unfurled our heels and shoved. Then
      there was a rush, and a <hi rend="italics">Bang, Bang, Bang!</hi> and the bullets fairly whizzed
      around us! We heard them sing out:
    </p>
   <p xml:id="D4638111-4852-4832-84C5-48EDE02885B6">
      "Here they are! They've broke for the river! After 'em, boys,
      and turn loose the dogs!"
    </p>
   <p xml:id="3BFD2F4A-2404-4DBF-A87B-CF04B2EE33AD">
      So here they come, full tilt. We could hear them because they wore
      boots and yelled, but we didn't wear no boots and didn't yell. We
      was in the path to the mill; and when they got pretty close on to us we
      dodged into the bush and let them go by, and then dropped in behind them.
      They'd had all the dogs shut up, so they wouldn't scare off the
      robbers; but by this time somebody had let them loose, and here they come,
      making powwow enough for a million; but they was our dogs; so we stopped
      in our tracks till they catched up; and when they see it warn't nobody but
      us, and no excitement to offer them, they only just said howdy, and tore
      right ahead towards the shouting and clattering; and then we up-steam
      again, and whizzed along after them till we was nearly to the mill, and
      then struck up through the bush to where my canoe was tied, and hopped in
      and pulled for dear life towards the middle of the river, but didn't make
      no more noise than we was obleeged to. Then we struck out, easy and
      comfortable, for the island where my raft was; and we could hear them
      yelling and barking at each other all up and down the bank, till we was so
      far away the sounds got dim and died out. And when we stepped on to
      the raft I says:
    </p>
   <p xml:id="71D0403F-D751-4DD7-8C8F-2BB8A732F78D">
      "<hi rend="italics">Now</hi>, old Jim, you're a free man again, and I bet you won't ever be a

      When me and <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> heard that we didn't feel so brash as what we did before.

      I knowed he was white inside, and I <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckoned</orig><reg>thought</reg></choice></distinct> he'd say what he did say—so
      it was all right now, and I told <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom</rs>  was a-going for a doctor. He

      budge; so he was for crawling out and setting the raft loose himself; but
      we wouldn't let him. Then he give us a piece of his mind, but it
      didn't do no good.

      "Well, then, if you're bound to go, I'll tell you the way to do when you
      get to the village. Shut the door and blindfold the doctor tight and
      fast, and make him swear to be silent as the grave, and put a purse full
      of gold in his hand, and then take and lead him all around the back alleys
      and everywheres in the dark, and then fetch him here in the canoe, in a
      roundabout way amongst the islands, and search him and take his chalk away
      from him, and don't give it back to him till you get him back to the
      village, or else he will chalk this raft so he can find it again. It's the

      THE doctor was an old man; a very nice, kind-looking old man when I got
      him up. I told him me and my brother was over on Spanish Island
      hunting yesterday afternoon, and camped on a piece of a raft we found, and
      about midnight he must a kicked his gun in his dreams, for it went off and
      shot him in the leg, and we wanted him to go over there and fix it and not
      say nothing about it, nor let anybody know, because we wanted to come home
      this evening and surprise the folks.

   <p xml:id="E0EB9778-0F12-4E2C-BF72-C8796718804E">

   <p xml:id="0AC7E40D-AFA0-42E2-8C8C-4DFCA7361B4A">
      "The Phelpses, down yonder."
    </p>
   <p xml:id="CDE82295-9010-43DF-AF22-BC0E973F645D">
      "Oh," he says. And after a minute, he says:
    </p>
   <p xml:id="AAAC85BE-7528-4674-A161-1300590CBF2B">
      "How'd you say he got shot?"

   <p xml:id="B9B527A9-A92A-4C85-A9F1-C55758E7601E">

      "Singular dream," he says.

   <p xml:id="61DBF38E-FA44-4D47-8EF3-158E3E0D30EC">
      So he lit up his lantern, and got his saddle-bags, and we started. But
      when he sees the canoe he didn't like the look of her—said she was
      big enough for one, but didn't look pretty safe for two. I says:
    </p>
   <p xml:id="5AEE7ECE-CFDA-4180-9F18-61497EA663A1">
      "Oh, you needn't be afeard, sir, she carried the three of us easy enough."

   <p xml:id="BFC85DEF-8DD1-422E-A9D4-5491655B486A">
      "Why, me and Sid, and—and—and <hi rend="italics">the guns</hi>; that's what I mean."
    </p>
   <p xml:id="0029E4DA-440A-42ED-95EB-7370025E4F9B">
      "Oh," he says.

      But he put his foot on the gunnel and rocked her, and shook his head, and
      said he <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckoned</orig><reg>thought</reg></choice></distinct> he'd look around for a bigger one. But they was all
      locked and chained; so he took my canoe, and said for me to wait till he
      come back, or I could hunt around further, or maybe I better go down home
      and get them ready for the surprise if I wanted to. But I said I
      didn't; so I told him just how to find the raft, and then he started.
    </p>
   <p xml:id="217A029C-E93C-4BEE-84B1-E0D1E9783195">
      I struck an idea pretty soon. I says to myself, spos'n he can't fix
      that leg just in three shakes of a sheep's tail, as the saying is? spos'n
      it takes him three or four days? What are we going to do?—lay
      around there till he lets the cat out of the bag? No, sir; I know
      what <hi rend="italics">I'll</hi> do. I'll wait, and when he comes back if he says he's got
      to go any more I'll get down there, too, if I swim; and we'll take and tie
      him, and keep him, and shove out down the river; and when Tom's done with
      him we'll give him what it's worth, or all we got, and then let him get
      ashore.

   <p xml:id="EB7BEC70-E8D3-4107-BCA9-23A6200D30B1">
      So then I crept into a lumber-pile to get some sleep; and next time I
      waked up the sun was away up over my head! I shot out and went for
      the doctor's house, but they told me he'd gone away in the night some time
      or other, and warn't back yet. Well, thinks I, that looks powerful
      bad for Tom, and I'll dig out for the island right off. So away I
      shoved, and turned the corner, and nearly rammed my head into Uncle
      Silas's stomach! He says:

      "She needn't," I says, "because we was all right. We followed the
      men and the dogs, but they outrun us, and we lost them; but we thought we
      heard them on the water, so we got a canoe and took out after them and
      crossed over, but couldn't find nothing of them; so we cruised along up-shore
      till we got kind of tired and beat out; and tied up the canoe and
      went to sleep, and never waked up till about an hour ago; then we paddled
      over here to hear the news, and Sid's at the post-office to see what he
      can hear, and I'm a-branching out to get something to eat for us, and then
      we're going home."

   <p xml:id="67ED825A-499F-45E8-B266-A580EB29F156">
      So then we went to the post-office to get "Sid"; but just as I
      suspicioned, he warn't there; so the old man he got a letter out of the
      office, and we waited awhile longer, but Sid didn't come; so the old man
      said, come along, let Sid foot it home, or canoe it, when he got done
      fooling around—but we would ride. I couldn't get him to let me
      stay and wait for Sid; and he said there warn't no use in it, and I must
      come along, and let Aunt Sally see we was all right.

      When we got home Aunt Sally was that glad to see me she laughed and cried

      and tucked me in, and mothered me so good I felt mean, and like I couldn't
      look her in the face; and she set down on the bed and talked with me a

      would squeeze my hand, or maybe kiss me, and tell me to say it again, and
      keep on saying it, because it done her good, and she was in so much
      trouble. And when she was going away she looked down in my eyes so
      steady and gentle, and says:

      towards the road and the tears in them; and I wished I could do something
      for her, but I couldn't, only to swear that I wouldn't never do nothing to

      I followed the men to see what they was going to do with Jim; and the old
      doctor and Uncle Silas followed after <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom</rs> nto the house. The men
      was very huffy, and some of them wanted to hang Jim for an example to all
      the other niggers around there, so they wouldn't be trying to run away
      like <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> done, and making such a raft of trouble, and keeping a whole

      said, don't do it, it wouldn't answer at all; he ain't our nigger, and his
      owner would turn up and make us pay for him, sure. So that cooled
      them down a little, because the people that's always the most anxious for
      to hang a nigger that hain't done just right is always the very ones that
      ain't the most anxious to pay for him when they've got their satisfaction

      him, and chained him again, and not to no bed-leg this time, but to a big
      staple drove into the bottom log, and chained his hands, too, and both
      legs, and said he warn't to have nothing but bread and water to eat after
      this till his owner come, or he was sold at auction because he didn't come
      in a certain length of time, and filled up our hole, and said a couple of

      a bulldog tied to the door in the daytime; and about this time they was
      through with the job and was tapering off with a kind of generl good-bye

      "Don't be no rougher on him than you're obleeged to, because he ain't a
      bad nigger. When I got to where I found the boy I see I couldn't cut
      the bullet out without some help, and he warn't in no condition for me to
      leave to go and get help; and he got a little worse and a little worse,
      and after a long time he went out of his head, and wouldn't let me come
      a-nigh him any more, and said if I chalked his raft he'd kill me, and no
      end of wild foolishness like that, and I see I couldn't do anything at all
      with him; so I says, I got to have <hi rend="italics">help</hi> somehow; and the minute I says it
      out crawls this nigger from somewheres and says he'll help, and he done
      it, too, and done it very well. Of course I judged he must be a
      runaway nigger, and there I <hi rend="italics">was</hi>! and there I had to stick right straight
      along all the rest of the day and all night. It was a fix, I tell
      you! I had a couple of patients with the chills, and of course I'd of
      liked to run up to town and see them, but I dasn't, because the nigger
      might get away, and then I'd be to blame; and yet never a skiff come close
      enough for me to hail. So there I had to stick plumb until daylight
      this morning; and I never see a nigger that was a better nuss or
      faithfuller, and yet he was risking his freedom to do it, and was all
      tired out, too, and I see plain enough he'd been worked main hard lately.
      I liked the nigger for that; I tell you, gentlemen, a nigger like
      that is worth a thousand dollars—and kind treatment, too. I
      had everything I needed, and the boy was doing as well there as he would a
      done at home—better, maybe, because it was so quiet; but there I
      <hi rend="italics">was</hi>, with both of 'm on my hands, and there I had to stick till about dawn
      this morning; then some men in a skiff come by, and as good luck would
      have it the nigger was setting by the pallet with his head propped on his
      knees sound asleep; so I motioned them in quiet, and they slipped up on
      him and grabbed him and tied him before he knowed what he was about, and
      we never had no trouble. And the boy being in a kind of a flighty sleep,
      too, we muffled the oars and hitched the raft on, and towed her over very
      nice and quiet, and the nigger never made the least row nor said a word
      from the start. He ain't no bad nigger, gentlemen; that's what I
      think about him."

      Then the others softened up a little, too, and I was mighty thankful to

      Then they come out and locked him up. I hoped they was going to say
      he could have one or two of the chains took off, because they was rotten
      heavy, or could have meat and greens with his bread and water; but they
      didn't think of it, and I <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckoned</orig><reg>thought</reg></choice></distinct> it warn't best for me to mix in, but I
      judged I'd get the doctor's yarn to Aunt Sally somehow or other as soon as

   <p xml:id="5B398955-ACAD-4816-BAAA-FB17405D372B">
      Next morning I heard Tom was a good deal better, and they said Aunt Sally
      was gone to get a nap. So I slips to the sick-room, and if I found
      him awake I <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckoned</orig><reg>thought</reg></choice></distinct> we could put up a yarn for the family that would
      wash. But he was sleeping, and sleeping very peaceful, too; and pale, not
      fire-faced the way he was when he come. So I set down and laid for
      him to wake. In about half an hour Aunt Sally comes gliding in, and
      there I was, up a stump again! She motioned me to be still, and set
      down by me, and begun to whisper, and said we could all be joyful now,
      because all the symptoms was first-rate, and he'd been sleeping like that
      for ever so long, and looking better and peacefuller all the time, and ten
      to one he'd wake up in his right mind.

      that night that gave him a rattling ruputation, because the oldest man in
      the world couldn't a understood it. So Tom's <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_polly">Aunt Polly</rs>, she told
