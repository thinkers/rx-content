        CHAPTER I.
      </head>
      <p> YOU don't know about me without you have read a book by the name of The Adventures of <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom Sawyer</rs> but that ain't no matter. That book was made by Mr. <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_mark_twain">Mark Twain</rs>, and he told the truth, mainly. There was things which he stretched, but mainly he told the truth. That is nothing. I <distinct type="l_huck"><choice>

              <reg>have never seen</reg>
            </choice></distinct> anybody <distinct type="l_huck"><choice>

              <reg>who didn't lie</reg>
            </choice></distinct> one time or another, without it was <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_polly">Aunt Polly</rs>, or <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_widow_douglas">the widow</rs>, or maybe <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_mary">Mary</rs>. <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_polly">Aunt Polly</rs>&#x2014;Tom's <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_polly">Aunt Polly</rs>, she is&#x2014;and Mary, and the <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_widow_douglas">Widow Douglas</rs> is all told about in that book, which is mostly a true book, with some stretchers, as I said before. </p>
      <milestone n="Civilizing Huck" unit="scene" xml:id="ch1sc1"/>         
      <p> Now the way that the book winds up is this: Tom and <distinct type="l_huck"><choice>
              <orig>me</orig>
              <reg>I</reg>
            </choice></distinct> found the money that the robbers hid in the cave, and it made us rich. We got <measure>six thousand dollars</measure> apiece&#x2014;all gold. It was an awful sight of money when it was piled up. Well, <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_judge_thatcher">Judge Thatcher</rs> he took it and put it out at interest, and it fetched us a dollar a day apiece all the year round&#x2014;more than <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>a body</orig><reg>somebody</reg></choice></distinct> could tell what to do with. The <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_widow_douglas">Widow Douglas</rs> she took me for her son, and allowed she would sivilize me; but it was rough living in the house all the time, considering how dismal regular and decent the widow was in all her ways; and so when I couldn't stand it no longer I lit out. I got into my old rags and my sugar-hogshead again, and was free and satisfied. But <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom Sawyer</rs>he hunted me up and said he was going to start a band of robbers, and I might join if I would go back to the widow and be respectable. So I went back. </p>
      <p>
        The widow she cried over me, and called me a poor lost lamb, and she
        called me a lot of other names, too, but she never meant no harm by it.
        She put me in them new clothes again, and I couldn't do nothing but sweat
        and sweat, and feel all cramped up. Well, then, the old thing
        commenced again. The widow rung a bell for supper, and you had to
        come to time. When you got to the table you couldn't go right to eating,
        but you had to wait for the widow to tuck down her head and grumble a
        little over the victuals, though there warn't really anything the matter
        with them,&#x2014;that is, nothing only everything was cooked by itself.
        In a barrel of odds and ends it is different; things get mixed up,
        and the juice kind of swaps around, and the things go better.
      </p>
      <p>
        After supper she got out her book and learned me about Moses and the
        Bulrushers, and I was in a sweat to find out all about him; but by and by
        she let it out that Moses had been dead a considerable long time; so then
        I didn't care no more about him, because I don't take no stock in dead
        people.
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
        Pretty soon I wanted to smoke, and asked the widow to let me. But
        she wouldn't. She said it was a mean practice and wasn't clean, and
        I must try to not do it any more. That is just the way with some
        people. They get down on a thing when they don't know nothing about
        it. Here she was a-bothering about Moses, which was no kin to her,
        and no use to anybody, being gone, you see, yet finding a power of fault
        with me for doing a thing that had some good in it. And she took
        snuff, too; of course that was all right, because she done it herself.
      </p>
      <milestone n="Miss Watson" unit="scene" xml:id="ch1sc2"/>   
      <p>
        Her sister, Miss Watson, a tolerable slim old maid, with goggles on, had
        just come to live with her, and took a set at me now with a spelling-book.
        She worked me middling hard for about an hour, and then the widow made her
        ease up. I couldn't stood it much longer. Then for an hour it
        was deadly dull, and I was fidgety. <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_miss_watson">Miss Watson</rs> would say, <said who="#c_miss_watson">"Don't
        put your feet up there, Huckleberry;"</said> and <said who="#c_miss_watson">"Don't scrunch up like that,
          Huckleberry&#x2014;set up straight;"</said> and pretty soon she would say, <said who="#c_miss_watson">"Don't
        gap and stretch like that, Huckleberry&#x2014;why don't you try to behave?"</said>
        Then she told me all about the bad place, and I said I wished I was
        there. She got mad then, but I didn't mean no harm. All I wanted was
        to go somewheres; all I wanted was a change, I warn't particular. She
        said it was wicked to say what I said; said she wouldn't say it for the
        whole world; she was going to live so as to go to the good place. Well,
        I couldn't see no advantage in going where she was going, so I made up my
        mind I wouldn't try for it. But I never said so, because it would
        only make trouble, and wouldn't do no good.
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
        Now she had got a start, and she went on and told me all about the good
        place. She said all <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>a body</orig><reg>somebody</reg></choice></distinct> would have to do there was to go around
        all day long with a harp and sing, forever and ever. So I didn't
        think much of it. But I never said so. I asked her if she <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckoned</orig><reg>thought</reg></choice></distinct>
        <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom Sawyer</rs>would go there, and she said not by a considerable sight.
        I was glad about that, because I wanted him and me to be together.
      </p>
      <p>
        <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_miss_watson">Miss Watson</rs> she kept pecking at me, and it got tiresome and lonesome.
        By and by they fetched the niggers in and had prayers, and then
        everybody was off to bed. I went up to my room with a piece of
        candle, and put it on the table. Then I set down in a chair by the
        window and tried to think of something cheerful, but it warn't no use.
        I felt so lonesome I most wished I was dead. The stars were
        shining, and the leaves rustled in the woods ever so mournful; and I heard
        an owl, away off, who-whooing about somebody that was dead, and a
        whippowill and a dog crying about somebody that was going to die; and the
        wind was trying to whisper something to me, and I couldn't make out what
        it was, and so it made the cold shivers run over me. Then away out in the
        woods I heard that kind of a sound that a ghost makes when it wants to
        tell about something that's on its mind and can't make itself understood,
        and so can't rest easy in its grave, and has to go about that way every
        night grieving. I got so down-hearted and scared I did wish I had
        some company. Pretty soon a spider went crawling up my shoulder, and
        I flipped it off and it lit in the candle; and before I could budge it was
        all shriveled up. I didn't need anybody to tell me that that was an
        awful bad sign and would fetch me some bad luck, so I was scared and most
        shook the clothes off of me. I got up and turned around in my tracks three
        times and crossed my breast every time; and then I tied up a little lock
        of my hair with a thread to keep witches away. But I hadn't no
        confidence. You do that when you've lost a horseshoe that you've
        found, instead of nailing it up over the door, but I hadn't ever heard
        anybody say it was any way to keep off bad luck when you'd killed a
        spider.
      </p>
           <milestone n="Tom Sawyer waits" unit="scene"/>
      <p>
        I set down again, a-shaking all over, and got out my pipe for a smoke; for
        the house was all as still as death now, and so the widow wouldn't know.
        Well, after a long time I heard the clock away off in the town go boom&#x2014;boom&#x2014;boom&#x2014;twelve
        licks; and all still again&#x2014;stiller than ever. Pretty soon I heard a
        twig snap down in the dark amongst the trees&#x2014;something was a
        stirring. I set still and listened. Directly I could just
        barely hear a "me-yow! me-yow!" down there. That was good! Says
        I, "me-yow! me-yow!" as soft as I could, and then I put out the light and
        scrambled out of the window on to the shed. Then I slipped down to
        the ground and crawled in among the trees, and, sure enough, there was Tom
        Sawyer waiting for me.

       CHAPTER II.
    </head>
    <p>
      WE went tiptoeing along a path amongst the trees back towards the end of
      the widow's garden, stooping down so as the branches wouldn't scrape our
      heads. When we was passing by the kitchen I fell over a root and made a
      noise. We scrouched down and laid still. Miss Watson's big
      nigger, named Jim, was setting in the kitchen door; we could see him
      pretty clear, because there was a light behind him. He got up and
      stretched his neck out about a minute, listening. Then he says:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who dah?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He listened some more; then he come tiptoeing down and stood right between
      us; we could a touched him, nearly. Well, likely it was minutes and
      minutes that there warn't a sound, and we all there so close together.
      There was a place on my ankle thatgot got to itching, but I dasn't
      scratch it; and then my ear begun to itch; and next my back, right between
      my shoulders. Seemed like I'd die if I couldn't scratch. Well,
      I've noticed that thing plenty times since. If you are with the
      quality, or at a funeral, or trying to go to sleep when you ain't sleepy&#x2014;if
      you are anywheres where it won't do for you to scratch, why you will itch
      all over in upwards of a thousand places. Pretty soon <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> says:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say, who is you? Whar is you? Dog my cats ef I didn' hear
      sumf'n. Well, I know what I's gwyne to do: I's gwyne to set down
      here and listen tell I hears it agin."
    </p>
    <p>
       
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
      So he set down on the ground betwixt me and Tom. He leaned his back
      up against a tree, and stretched his legs out till one of them most
      touched one of mine. My nose begun to itch. It itched till the
      tears come into my eyes. But I dasn't scratch. Then it begun
      to itch on the inside. Next I got to itching underneath. I didn't
      know how I was going to set still. This miserableness went on as much as
      six or seven minutes; but it seemed a sight longer than that. I was
      itching in eleven different places now. I <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckoned</orig><reg>thought</reg></choice></distinct> I couldn't stand
      it more'n a minute longer, but I set my teeth hard and got ready to try.
      Just then <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> begun to breathe heavy; next he begun to snore&#x2014;and
      then I was pretty soon comfortable again.
    </p>
    <p>
      <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom</rs> e made a sign to me&#x2014;kind of a little noise with his mouth&#x2014;and
      we went creeping away on our hands and knees. When we was ten foot
      off Tom whispered to me, and wanted to tie <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> to the tree for fun. But
      I said no; he might wake and make a disturbance, and then they'd find out
      I warn't in. Then <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom</rs> aid he hadn't got candles enough, and he would slip
      in the kitchen and get some more. I didn't want him to try. I
      said <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> might wake up and come. But Tom wanted to resk it; so we
      slid in there and got three candles, and <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom</rs> aid five cents on the table
      for pay. Then we got out, and I was in a sweat to get away; but nothing
      would do <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom</rs> ut he must crawl to where <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> was, on his hands and knees,
      and play something on him. I waited, and it seemed a good while,
      everything was so still and lonesome.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as Tom was back we cut along the path, around the garden fence,
      and by and by fetched up on the steep top of the hill the other side of
      the house. <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom</rs> aid he slipped Jim's hat off of his head and hung it
      on a limb right over him, and <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> stirred a little, but he didn't wake.
      Afterwards <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> said the witches be witched him and put him in a trance,
      and rode him all over the State, and then set him under the trees again,
      and hung his hat on a limb to show who done it. And next time Jim
      told it he said they rode him down to New Orleans; and, after that, every
      time he told it he spread it more and more, till by and by he said they
      rode him all over the world, and tired him most to death, and his back was
      all over saddle-boils. <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> was monstrous proud about it, and he got
      so he wouldn't hardly notice the other niggers. Niggers would come
      miles to hear <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> tell about it, and he was more looked up to than any
      nigger in that country. Strange niggers would stand with their
      mouths open and look him all over, same as if he was a wonder. Niggers
      is always talking about witches in the dark by the kitchen fire; but
      whenever one was talking and letting on to know all about such things, Jim
      would happen in and say, "Hm! What you know 'bout witches?" and that
      nigger was corked up and had to take a back seat. <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> always kept
      that five-center piece round his neck with a string, and said it was a
      charm the devil give to him with his own hands, and told him he could cure
      anybody with it and fetch witches whenever he wanted to just by saying
      something to it; but he never told what it was he said to it. Niggers
      would come from all around there and give <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> anything they had, just for
      a sight of that five-center piece; but they wouldn't touch it, because the
      devil had had his hands on it. <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> was most ruined for a servant,
      because he got stuck up on account of having seen the devil and been rode
      by witches.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, when Tom and me got to the edge of the hilltop we looked away down
      into the village and could see three or four lights twinkling, where there
      was sick folks, maybe; and the stars over us was sparkling ever so fine;
      and down by the village was the river, a whole mile broad, and awful still
      and grand. We went down the hill and found Jo Harper and Ben Rogers,
      and two or three more of the boys, hid in the old tanyard. So we
      unhitched a skiff and pulled down the river two mile and a half, to the
      big scar on the hillside, and went ashore.
    </p>
    <p>
      We went to a clump of bushes, and <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom</rs> ade everybody swear to keep the
      secret, and then showed them a hole in the hill, right in the thickest
      part of the bushes. Then we lit the candles, and crawled in on our
      hands and knees. We went about two hundred yards, and then the cave
      opened up. <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom</rs> oked about amongst the passages, and pretty soon ducked
      under a wall where you wouldn't a noticed that there was a hole. We
      went along a narrow place and got into a kind of room, all damp and sweaty
      and cold, and there we stopped. <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom</rs> ays:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, we'll start this band of robbers and call it Tom Sawyer's Gang.
      Everybody that wants to join has got to take an oath, and write his name
      in blood."
    </p>
    <p>
       
    </p>
    <figure>
      <graphic url="media/c02-25.jpg" /><lb />
    </figure>
    <p>
       <lb />
    </p>
    <p>
      Everybody was willing. So <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom</rs> ot out a sheet of paper that he had
      wrote the oath on, and read it. It swore every boy to stick to the
      band, and never tell any of the secrets; and if anybody done anything to
      any boy in the band, whichever boy was ordered to kill that person and his
      family must do it, and he mustn't eat and he mustn't sleep till he had
      killed them and hacked a cross in their breasts, which was the sign of the
      band. And nobody that didn't belong to the band could use that mark, and
      if he did he must be sued; and if he done it again he must be killed.
      And if anybody that belonged to the band told the secrets, he must
      have his throat cut, and then have his carcass burnt up and the ashes
      scattered all around, and his name blotted off of the list with blood and
      never mentioned again by the gang, but have a curse put on it and be
      forgot forever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everybody said it was a real beautiful oath, and asked <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom</rs> f he got it
      out of his own head. He said, some of it, but the rest was out of
      pirate-books and robber-books, and every gang that was high-toned had it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some thought it would be good to kill the <hi rend="italics">families</hi> of boys that told the
      secrets. <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom</rs> aid it was a good idea, so he took a pencil and wrote
      it in. Then Ben Rogers says:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here's Huck Finn, he hain't got no family; what you going to do 'bout
      him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, hain't he got a father?" says <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom Sawyer</rs>
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, he's got a father, but you can't never find him these days. He
      used to lay drunk with the hogs in the tanyard, but he hain't been seen in
      these parts for a year or more."
    </p>
    <p>
      They talked it over, and they was going to rule me out, because they said
      every boy must have a family or somebody to kill, or else it wouldn't be
      fair and square for the others. Well, nobody could think of anything
      to do&#x2014;everybody was stumped, and set still. I was most ready
      to cry; but all at once I thought of a way, and so I offered them Miss Watson&#x2014;they could kill her. Everybody said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, she'll do. That's all right. Huck can come in."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then they all stuck a pin in their fingers to get blood to sign with, and
      I made my mark on the paper.
    </p>

      "Now," says Ben Rogers, "what's the line of business of this Gang?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing only robbery and murder," <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom</rs> aid.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But who are we going to rob?&#x2014;houses, or cattle, or&#x2014;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stuff! stealing cattle and such things ain't robbery; it's burglary,"
      says <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom Sawyer</rs> "We ain't burglars. That ain't no sort of
      style. We are highwaymen. We stop stages and carriages on the
      road, with masks on, and kill the people and take their watches and
      money."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Must we always kill the people?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, certainly. It's best. Some authorities think different,
      but mostly it's considered best to kill them&#x2014;except some that you
      bring to the cave here, and keep them till they're ransomed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ransomed? What's that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know. But that's what they do. I've seen it in books;
      and so of course that's what we've got to do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But how can we do it if we don't know what it is?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, blame it all, we've <hi rend="italics">got</hi> to do it. Don't I tell you it's in the
      books? Do you want to go to doing different from what's in the
      books, and get things all muddled up?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, that's all very fine to <hi rend="italics">say</hi>, <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom Sawyer</rs> but how in the nation are
      these fellows going to be ransomed if we don't know how to do it to them?&#x2014;that's
      the thing I want to get at. Now, what do you <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckon</orig><reg>think</reg></choice></distinct> it is?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I don't know. But per'aps if we keep them till they're
      ransomed, it means that we keep them till they're dead."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, that's something <hi rend="italics">like</hi>. That'll answer. Why couldn't you
      said that before? We'll keep them till they're ransomed to death;
      and a bothersome lot they'll be, too&#x2014;eating up everything, and
      always trying to get loose."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How you talk, Ben Rogers. How can they get loose when there's a
      guard over them, ready to shoot them down if they move a peg?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A guard! Well, that <hi rend="italics">is</hi> good. So somebody's got to set up all
      night and never get any sleep, just so as to watch them. I think
      that's foolishness. Why can't <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>a body</orig><reg>somebody</reg></choice></distinct> take a club and ransom them as soon
      as they get here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because it ain't in the books so&#x2014;that's why. Now, Ben Rogers,
      do you want to do things regular, or don't you?&#x2014;that's the idea.
      Don't you <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckon</orig><reg>think</reg></choice></distinct> that the people that made the books knows what's
      the correct thing to do? Do you <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckon</orig><reg>think</reg></choice></distinct> <hi rend="italics">you</hi> can learn 'em anything?
      Not by a good deal. No, sir, we'll just go on and ransom them in the
      regular way."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right. I don't mind; but I say it's a fool way, anyhow. Say,
      do we kill the women, too?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Ben Rogers, if I was as ignorant as you I wouldn't let on. Kill
      the women? No; nobody ever saw anything in the books like that.
      You fetch them to the cave, and you're always as polite as pie to
      them; and by and by they fall in love with you, and never want to go home
      any more."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, if that's the way I'm agreed, but I don't take no stock in it.
      Mighty soon we'll have the cave so cluttered up with women, and fellows
      waiting to be ransomed, that there won't be no place for the robbers. But
      go ahead, I ain't got nothing to say."
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Tommy Barnes was asleep now, and when they waked him up he was
      scared, and cried, and said he wanted to go home to his ma, and didn't
      want to be a robber any more.
    </p>
    <p>
      So they all made fun of him, and called him cry-baby, and that made him
      mad, and he said he would go straight and tell all the secrets. But
      <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom</rs> ive him five cents to keep quiet, and said we would all go home and
      meet next week, and rob somebody and kill some people.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ben Rogers said he couldn't get out much, only Sundays, and so he wanted
      to begin next Sunday; but all the boys said it would be wicked to do it on
      Sunday, and that settled the thing. They agreed to get together and
      fix a day as soon as they could, and then we elected <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom Sawyer</rs>first
      captain and Jo Harper second captain of the Gang, and so started home.
    </p>
    <p>
      I clumb up the shed and crept into my window just before day was breaking.
      My new clothes was all greased up and clayey, and I was dog-tired.

        CHAPTER III.
      </head>
      <p>
        WELL, I got a good going-over in the morning from old <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_miss_watson">Miss Watson</rs> on
        account of my clothes; but the widow she didn't scold, but only cleaned
        off the grease and clay, and looked so sorry that I thought I would behave
        awhile if I could. Then <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_miss_watson">Miss Watson</rs> she took me in the closet and
        prayed, but nothing come of it. She told me to pray every day, and
        whatever I asked for I would get it. But it warn't so. I tried
        it. Once I got a fish-line, but no hooks. It warn't any good to me
        without hooks. I tried for the hooks three or four times, but
        somehow I couldn't make it work. By and by, one day, I asked <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_miss_watson">Miss Watson</rs> to try for me, but she said I was a fool. She never told me
        why, and I couldn't make it out no way.
      </p>
      <p>
        I set down one time back in the woods, and had a long think about it.
        I says to myself, if <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>a body</orig><reg>somebody</reg></choice></distinct> can get anything they pray for, why
        don't Deacon Winn get back the money he lost on pork? Why can't the
        widow get back her silver snuffbox that was stole? Why can't <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_miss_watson">Miss Watson</rs> fat up? No, says I to my self, there ain't nothing in it. I
        went and told the widow about it, and she said the thing <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>a body</orig><reg>somebody</reg></choice></distinct> could get
        by praying for it was "spiritual gifts." This was too many for me,
        but she told me what she meant&#x2014;I must help other people, and do
        everything I could for other people, and look out for them all the time,
        and never think about myself. This was including Miss Watson, as I took
        it. I went out in the woods and turned it over in my mind a long
        time, but I couldn't see no advantage about it&#x2014;except for the other
        people; so at last I <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckoned</orig><reg>thought</reg></choice></distinct> I wouldn't worry about it any more, but just
        let it go. Sometimes the widow would take me one side and talk about
        Providence in a way to make <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>a body</orig><reg>somebody</reg></choice></distinct>'s mouth water; but maybe next day <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_miss_watson">Miss Watson</rs> would take hold and knock it all down again. I judged I could
        see that there was two Providences, and a poor chap would stand
        considerable show with the widow's Providence, but if Miss Watson's got
        him there warn't no help for him any more. I thought it all out, and
        <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckoned</orig><reg>thought</reg></choice></distinct> I would belong to the widow's if he wanted me, though I couldn't
        make out how he was a-going to be any better off then than what he was
        before, seeing I was so ignorant, and so kind of low-down and ornery.
      </p>
      <p>
        <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_pap">Pap</rs> he hadn't been seen for more than a year, and that was comfortable for
        me; I didn't want to see him no more. He used to always whale me
        when he was sober and could get his hands on me; though I used to take to
        the woods most of the time when he was around. Well, about this time
        he was found in the river drownded, about twelve mile above town, so
        people said. They judged it was him, anyway; said this drownded man
        was just his size, and was ragged, and had uncommon long hair, which was
        all like pap; but they couldn't make nothing out of the face, because it
        had been in the water so long it warn't much like a face at all. They
        said he was floating on his back in the water. They took him and
        buried him on the bank. But I warn't comfortable long, because I
        happened to think of something. I knowed mighty well that a drownded
        man don't float on his back, but on his face. So I knowed, then,
        that this warn't pap, but a woman dressed up in a man's clothes. So
        I was uncomfortable again. I judged the old man would turn up again
        by and by, though I wished he wouldn't.
      </p>
      <p>
        We played robber now and then about a month, and then I resigned. All
        the boys did. We hadn't robbed nobody, hadn't killed any people, but
        only just pretended. We used to hop out of the woods and go charging
        down on hog-drivers and women in carts taking garden stuff to market, but
        we never hived any of them. <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom Sawyer</rs>called the hogs "ingots," and
        he called the turnips and stuff "julery," and we would go to the cave and
        powwow over what we had done, and how many people we had killed and
        marked. But I couldn't see no profit in it. One time <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom</rs> ent
        a boy to run about town with a blazing stick, which he called a slogan
        (which was the sign for the Gang to get together), and then he said he had
        got secret news by his spies that next day a whole parcel of Spanish
        merchants and rich A-rabs was going to camp in Cave Hollow with two
        hundred elephants, and six hundred camels, and over a thousand "sumter"
        mules, all loaded down with di'monds, and they didn't have only a guard of
        four hundred soldiers, and so we would lay in ambuscade, as he called it,
        and kill the lot and scoop the things. He said we must slick up our
        swords and guns, and get ready. He never could go after even a
        turnip-cart but he must have the swords and guns all scoured up for it,
        though they was only lath and broomsticks, and you might scour at them
        till you rotted, and then they warn't worth a mouthful of ashes more than
        what they was before. I didn't believe we could lick such a crowd of
        Spaniards and A-rabs, but I wanted to see the camels and elephants, so I
        was on hand next day, Saturday, in the ambuscade; and when we got the word
        we rushed out of the woods and down the hill. But there warn't no
        Spaniards and A-rabs, and there warn't no camels nor no elephants. It
        warn't anything but a Sunday-school picnic, and only a primer-class at
        that. We busted it up, and chased the children up the hollow; but we
        never got anything but some doughnuts and jam, though Ben Rogers got a rag
        doll, and Jo Harper got a hymn-book and a tract; and then the teacher
        charged in, and made us drop everything and cut.

        I didn't see no di'monds, and I told <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom Sawyer</rs>so. He said
        there was loads of them there, anyway; and he said there was A-rabs there,
        too, and elephants and things. I said, why couldn't we see them,
        then? He said if I warn't so ignorant, but had read a book called
        Don Quixote, I would know without asking. He said it was all done by
        enchantment. He said there was hundreds of soldiers there, and
        elephants and treasure, and so on, but we had enemies which he called
        magicians; and they had turned the whole thing into an infant
        Sunday-school, just out of spite. I said, all right; then the thing
        for us to do was to go for the magicians. <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom Sawyer</rs>said I was a
        numskull.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Why," said he, "a magician could call up a lot of genies, and they would
        hash you up like nothing before you could say Jack Robinson. They
        are as tall as a tree and as big around as a church."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Well," I says, "s'pose we got some genies to help <hi rend="italics">us</hi>&#x2014;can't we lick
        the other crowd then?"
      </p>
      <p>
        "How you going to get them?"
      </p>
      <p>
        "I don't know. How do <hi rend="italics">they</hi> get them?"
      </p>
      <p>
        "Why, they rub an old tin lamp or an iron ring, and then the genies come
        tearing in, with the thunder and lightning a-ripping around and the smoke
        a-rolling, and everything they're told to do they up and do it. They
        don't think nothing of pulling a shot-tower up by the roots, and belting a
        Sunday-school superintendent over the head with it&#x2014;or any other
        man."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Who makes them tear around so?"
      </p>
      <p>
        "Why, whoever rubs the lamp or the ring. They belong to whoever rubs
        the lamp or the ring, and they've got to do whatever he says. If he
        tells them to build a palace forty miles long out of di'monds, and fill it
        full of chewing-gum, or whatever you want, and fetch an emperor's daughter
        from China for you to marry, they've got to do it&#x2014;and they've got to
        do it before sun-up next morning, too. And more: they've got
        to waltz that palace around over the country wherever you want it, you
        understand."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Well," says I, "I think they are a pack of flat-heads for not keeping the
        palace themselves 'stead of fooling them away like that. And what's
        more&#x2014;if I was one of them I would see a man in Jericho before I
        would drop my business and come to him for the rubbing of an old tin
        lamp."
      </p>
      <p>
        "How you talk, Huck Finn. Why, you'd <hi rend="italics">have</hi> to come when he rubbed it,
        whether you wanted to or not."
      </p>
      <p>
        "What! and I as high as a tree and as big as a church? All right,
        then; I <hi rend="italics">would</hi> come; but I lay I'd make that man climb the highest tree
        there was in the country."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Shucks, it ain't no use to talk to you, Huck Finn. You don't seem
        to know anything, somehow&#x2014;perfect saphead."
      </p>
      <p>
        I thought all this over for two or three days, and then I <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckoned</orig><reg>thought</reg></choice></distinct> I would
        see if there was anything in it. I got an old tin lamp and an iron
        ring, and went out in the woods and rubbed and rubbed till I sweat like an
        Injun, calculating to build a palace and sell it; but it warn't no use,
        none of the genies come. So then I judged that all that stuff was
        only just one of Tom Sawyer's lies. I <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckoned</orig><reg>thought</reg></choice></distinct> he believed in the
        A-rabs and the elephants, but as for me I think different. It had
        all the marks of a Sunday-school.

        CHAPTER IV.
      </head>
      <p>
        WELL, three or four months run along, and it was well into the winter now.
        I had been to school most all the time and could spell and read and write
        just a little, and could say the multiplication table up to six times
        seven is thirty-five, and I don't <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckon</orig><reg>think</reg></choice></distinct> I could ever get any further than
        that if I was to live forever. I don't take no stock in mathematics,
        anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
        At first I hated the school, but by and by I got so I could stand it.
        Whenever I got uncommon tired I played hookey, and the hiding I got next
        day done me good and cheered me up. So the longer I went to school
        the easier it got to be. I was getting sort of used to the widow's
        ways, too, and they warn't so raspy on me. Living in a house and
        sleeping in a bed pulled on me pretty tight mostly, but before the cold
        weather I used to slide out and sleep in the woods sometimes, and so that
        was a rest to me. I liked the old ways best, but I was getting so I
        liked the new ones, too, a little bit. The widow said I was coming along
        slow but sure, and doing very satisfactory. She said she warn't
        ashamed of me.
      </p>
      <p>
        One morning I happened to turn over the salt-cellar at breakfast. I
        reached for some of it as quick as I could to throw over my left shoulder
        and keep off the bad luck, but <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_miss_watson">Miss Watson</rs> was in ahead of me, and crossed
        me off. She says, "Take your hands away, Huckleberry; what a mess you are
        always making!" The widow put in a good word for me, but that warn't
        going to keep off the bad luck, I knowed that well enough. I started
        out, after breakfast, feeling worried and shaky, and wondering where it
        was going to fall on me, and what it was going to be. There is ways
        to keep off some kinds of bad luck, but this wasn't one of <distinct type="l_huck"><choice><orig>them</orig><reg>those</reg></choice></distinct> kind; so I
        never tried to do anything, but just poked along low-spirited and on the
        watch-out.
      </p>
      <p>
        I went down to the front garden and clumb over the stile where you go
        through the high board fence. There was an inch of new snow on the
        ground, and I seen somebody's tracks. They had come up from the
        quarry and stood around the stile a while, and then went on around the
        garden fence. It was funny they hadn't come in, after standing
        around so. I couldn't make it out. It was very curious,
        somehow. I was going to follow around, but I stooped down to look at
        the tracks first. I didn't notice anything at first, but next I did.
        There was a cross in the left boot-heel made with big nails, to keep
        off the devil.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was up in a second and shinning down the hill. I looked over my
        shoulder every now and then, but I didn't see nobody. I was at <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_judge_thatcher">Judge Thatcher</rs>'s as quick as I could get there. He said:
      </p>
      <p>
        "Why, my boy, you are all out of breath. Did you come for your
        interest?"
      </p>
      <p>
        "No, sir," I says; "is there some for me?"
      </p>
      <p>
        "Oh, yes, a half-yearly is in last night&#x2014;over a hundred and fifty
        dollars. Quite a fortune for you. You had better let me invest
        it along with your six thousand, because if you take it you'll spend it."
      </p>
      <p>
        "No, sir," I says, "I don't want to spend it. I don't want it at all&#x2014;nor
        the six thousand, nuther. I want you to take it; I want to give it
        to you&#x2014;the six thousand and all."

        He looked surprised. He couldn't seem to make it out. He says:
      </p>
      <p>
        "Why, what can you mean, my boy?"
      </p>
      <p>
        I says, "Don't you ask me no questions about it, please. You'll take
        it&#x2014;won't you?"
      </p>
      <p>
        He says:
      </p>
      <p>
        "Well, I'm puzzled. Is something the matter?"
      </p>
      <p>
        "Please take it," says I, "and don't ask me nothing&#x2014;then I won't
        have to tell no lies."
      </p>
      <p>
        He studied a while, and then he says:
      </p>
      <p>
        "Oho-o! I think I see. You want to <hi rend="italics">sell</hi> all your property to
        me&#x2014;not give it. That's the correct idea."
      </p>
      <p>
        Then he wrote something on a paper and read it over, and says:
      </p>
      <p>
        "There; you see it says 'for a consideration.' That means I have
        bought it of you and paid you for it. Here's a dollar for you.
        Now you sign it."
      </p>
      <p>
        So I signed it, and left.

        Miss Watson's nigger, Jim, had a hair-ball as big as your fist, which had
        been took out of the fourth stomach of an ox, and he used to do magic with
        it. He said there was a spirit inside of it, and it knowed
        everything. So I went to him that night and told him pap was here
        again, for I found his tracks in the snow. What I wanted to know
        was, what he was going to do, and was he going to stay? <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> got out
        his hair-ball and said something over it, and then he held it up and
        dropped it on the floor. It fell pretty solid, and only rolled about
        an inch. <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> tried it again, and then another time, and it acted
        just the same. <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> got down on his knees, and put his ear against it
        and listened. But it warn't no use; he said it wouldn't talk. He
        said sometimes it wouldn't talk without money. I told him I had an
        old slick counterfeit quarter that warn't no good because the brass showed
        through the silver a little, and it wouldn't pass nohow, even if the brass
        didn't show, because it was so slick it felt greasy, and so that would
        tell on it every time. (I <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckoned</orig><reg>thought</reg></choice></distinct> I wouldn't say nothing about the
        dollar I got from the judge.) I said it was pretty bad money, but maybe
        the hair-ball would take it, because maybe it wouldn't know the
        difference. <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> smelt it and bit it and rubbed it, and said he would
        manage so the hair-ball would think it was good. He said he would
        split open a raw Irish potato and stick the quarter in between and keep it
        there all night, and next morning you couldn't see no brass, and it
        wouldn't feel greasy no more, and so anybody in town would take it in a
        minute, let alone a hair-ball. Well, I knowed a potato would do that
        before, but I had forgot it.

        <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> put the quarter under the hair-ball, and got down and listened again.
        This time he said the hair-ball was all right. He said it would tell
        my whole fortune if I wanted it to. I says, go on. So the
        hair-ball talked to Jim, and <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> told it to me. He says:

        When I lit my candle and went up to my room that night there sat pap his

        CHAPTER V.
      </head>
      <p>
        I had shut the door to. Then I turned around and there he was.
        I used to be scared of him all the time, he tanned me so much.
        I <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckoned</orig><reg>thought</reg></choice></distinct> I was scared now, too; but in a minute I see I was
        mistaken&#x2014;that is, after the first jolt, as you may say, when my
        breath sort of hitched, he being so unexpected; but right away after I see
        I warn't scared of him worth bothring about.
      </p>
      <p>
        He was most fifty, and he looked it. His hair was long and tangled
        and greasy, and hung down, and you could see his eyes shining through like
        he was behind vines. It was all black, no gray; so was his long,
        mixed-up whiskers. There warn't no color in his face, where his face
        showed; it was white; not like another man's white, but a white to make a
        body sick, a white to make a body's flesh crawl&#x2014;a tree-toad white, a
        fish-belly white. As for his clothes&#x2014;just rags, that was all.
        He had one ankle resting on t'other knee; the boot on that foot was
        busted, and two of his toes stuck through, and he worked them now and
        then. His hat was laying on the floor&#x2014;an old black slouch with
        the top caved in, like a lid.
      </p>
      <p>
        I stood a-looking at him; he set there a-looking at me, with his chair
        tilted back a little. I set the candle down. I noticed the
        window was up; so he had clumb in by the shed. He kept a-looking me
        all over. By and by he says:
      </p>
      <p>
        "Starchy clothes&#x2014;very. You think you're a good deal of a
        big-bug, <hi rend="italics">don't</hi> you?"
      </p>
      <p>
        "Maybe I am, maybe I ain't," I says.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Don't you give me none o' your lip," says he. "You've put on
        considerable many frills since I been away. I'll take you down a peg
        before I get done with you. You're educated, too, they say&#x2014;can
        read and write. You think you're better'n your father, now, don't
        you, because he can't? <hi rend="italics">I'll</hi> take it out of you. Who told you
        you might meddle with such hifalut'n foolishness, hey?&#x2014;who told you
        you could?"
      </p>
      <p>
        "The widow. She told me."
      </p>
      <p>
        "The widow, hey?&#x2014;and who told the widow she could put in her shovel
        about a thing that ain't none of her business?"
      </p>
      <p>
        "Nobody never told her."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Well, I'll learn her how to meddle. And looky here&#x2014;you drop
        that school, you hear? I'll learn people to bring up a boy to put on
        airs over his own father and let on to be better'n what <hi rend="italics">he</hi> is. You
        lemme catch you fooling around that school again, you hear? Your
        mother couldn't read, and she couldn't write, nuther, before she died.
        None of the family couldn't before <hi rend="italics">they</hi> died. I can't; and
        here you're a-swelling yourself up like this. I ain't the man to
        stand it&#x2014;you hear? Say, lemme hear you read."
      </p>
      <p>
        I took up a book and begun something about General Washington and the
        wars. When I'd read about a half a minute, he fetched the book a whack
        with his hand and knocked it across the house. He says:
      </p>
      <p>
        "It's so. You can do it. I had my doubts when you told me.
        Now looky here; you stop that putting on frills. I won't have
        it. I'll lay for you, my smarty; and if I catch you about that
        school I'll tan you good. First you know you'll get religion, too. I
        never see such a son."
      </p>
      <p>
        He took up a little blue and yaller picture of some cows and a boy, and
        says:
      </p>
      <p>
        "What's this?"
      </p>
      <p>
        "It's something they give me for learning my lessons good."
      </p>
      <p>
        He tore it up, and says:
      </p>
      <p>
        "I'll give you something better&#x2014;I'll give you a cowhide."
      </p>
      <p>
        He set there a-mumbling and a-growling a minute, and then he says:
      </p>
      <p>
        "<hi rend="italics">Ain't</hi> you a sweet-scented dandy, though? A bed; and bedclothes; and
        a look'n'-glass; and a piece of carpet on the floor&#x2014;and your own
        father got to sleep with the hogs in the tanyard. I never see such a
        son. I bet I'll take some o' these frills out o' you before I'm done
        with you. Why, there ain't no end to your airs&#x2014;they say you're rich.
        Hey?&#x2014;how's that?"
      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
        "They lie&#x2014;that's how."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Looky here&#x2014;mind how you talk to me; I'm a-standing about all I can
        stand now&#x2014;so don't gimme no sass. I've been in town two days,
        and I hain't heard nothing but about you bein' rich. I heard about
        it away down the river, too. That's why I come. You git me
        that money to-morrow&#x2014;I want it."
      </p>
      <p>
        "I hain't got no money."
      </p>
      <p>
        "It's a lie. <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_judge_thatcher">Judge Thatcher</rs>'s got it. You git it. I want
        it."
      </p>
      <p>
        "I hain't got no money, I tell you. You ask <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_judge_thatcher">Judge Thatcher</rs>; he'll
        tell you the same."
      </p>
      <p>
        "All right. I'll ask him; and I'll make him pungle, too, or I'll
        know the reason why. Say, how much you got in your pocket? I
        want it."
      </p>
      <p>
        "I hain't got only a dollar, and I want that to&#x2014;"
      </p>
      <p>
        "It don't make no difference what you want it for&#x2014;you just shell it
        out."
      </p>
      <p>
        He took it and bit it to see if it was good, and then he said he was going
        down town to get some whisky; said he hadn't had a drink all day. When he
        had got out on the shed he put his head in again, and cussed me for
        putting on frills and trying to be better than him; and when I <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckoned</orig><reg>thought</reg></choice></distinct> he
        was gone he come back and put his head in again, and told me to mind about
        that school, because he was going to lay for me and lick me if I didn't
        drop that.
      </p>
      <p>
        Next day he was drunk, and he went to <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_judge_thatcher">Judge Thatcher</rs>'s and bullyragged
        him, and tried to make him give up the money; but he couldn't, and then he
        swore he'd make the law force him.
      </p>
      <p>
        The judge and the widow went to law to get the court to take me away from
        him and let one of them be my guardian; but it was a new judge that had
        just come, and he didn't know the old man; so he said courts mustn't
        interfere and separate families if they could help it; said he'd druther
        not take a child away from its father. So <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_judge_thatcher">Judge Thatcher</rs> and the
        widow had to quit on the business.
      </p>
      <p>
        That pleased the old man till he couldn't rest. He said he'd cowhide
        me till I was black and blue if I didn't raise some money for him. I
        borrowed three dollars from <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_judge_thatcher">Judge Thatcher</rs>, and pap took it and got drunk,
        and went a-blowing around and cussing and whooping and carrying on; and he
        kept it up all over town, with a tin pan, till most midnight; then they
        jailed him, and next day they had him before court, and jailed him again
        for a week. But he said <hi rend="italics">he</hi> was satisfied; said he was boss of his
        son, and he'd make it warm for <hi rend="italics">him</hi>.
      </p>
      <p>
        When he got out the new judge said he was a-going to make a man of him. So
        he took him to his own house, and dressed him up clean and nice, and had
        him to breakfast and dinner and supper with the family, and was just old
        pie to him, so to speak. And after supper he talked to him about
        temperance and such things till the old man cried, and said he'd been a
        fool, and fooled away his life; but now he was a-going to turn over a new
        leaf and be a man nobody wouldn't be ashamed of, and he hoped the judge
        would help him and not look down on him. The judge said he could hug
        him for <distinct type="l_huck"><choice><orig>them</orig><reg>those</reg></choice></distinct> words; so he cried, and his wife she cried again; pap said
        he'd been a man that had always been misunderstood before, and the judge
        said he believed it. The old man said that what a man wanted that
        was down was sympathy, and the judge said it was so; so they cried again.
        And when it was bedtime the old man rose up and held out his hand,
        and says:
      </p>
      <p>
        "Look at it, gentlemen and ladies all; take a-hold of it; shake it.
        There's a hand that was the hand of a hog; but it ain't so no more; it's
        the hand of a man that's started in on a new life, and'll die before he'll
        go back. You mark <distinct type="l_huck"><choice><orig>them</orig><reg>those</reg></choice></distinct> words&#x2014;don't forget I said them. It's
        a clean hand now; shake it&#x2014;don't be afeard."
      </p>
      <p>
        
      </p>
      <figure>
        <graphic url="media/c05-43.jpg" /><lb />
      </figure>
      <p>
        <lb />
      </p>
      <p>
        So they shook it, one after the other, all around, and cried. The
        judge's wife she kissed it. Then the old man he signed a pledge&#x2014;made
        his mark. The judge said it was the holiest time on record, or something
        like that. Then they tucked the old man into a beautiful room, which was
        the spare room, and in the night some time he got powerful thirsty and
        clumb out on to the porch-roof and slid down a stanchion and traded his
        new coat for a jug of forty-rod, and clumb back again and had a good old
        time; and towards daylight he crawled out again, drunk as a fiddler, and
        rolled off the porch and broke his left arm in two places, and was most
        froze to death when somebody found him after sun-up. And when they
        come to look at that spare room they had to take soundings before they
        could navigate it.
      </p>
      <p>
        The judge he felt kind of sore. He said he <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckoned</orig><reg>thought</reg></choice></distinct> <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>a body</orig><reg>somebody</reg></choice></distinct> could
        reform the old man with a shotgun, maybe, but he didn't know no other way.

      <p>
        WELL, pretty soon the old man was up and around again, and then he went
        for <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_judge_thatcher">Judge Thatcher</rs> in the courts to make him give up that money, and he
        went for me, too, for not stopping school. He catched me a couple of
        times and thrashed me, but I went to school just the same, and dodged him
        or outrun him most of the time. I didn't want to go to school much
        before, but I <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckoned</orig><reg>thought</reg></choice></distinct> I'd go now to spite pap. That law trial was a
        slow business&#x2014;appeared like they warn't ever going to get started on
        it; so every now and then I'd borrow two or three dollars off of the judge
        for him, to keep from getting a cowhiding. Every time he got money
        he got drunk; and every time he got drunk he raised Cain around town; and
        every time he raised Cain he got jailed. He was just suited&#x2014;this
        kind of thing was right in his line.
      </p>
      <p>
        He got to hanging around the widow's too much and so she told him at last
        that if he didn't quit using around there she would make trouble for him.
        Well, <hi rend="italics">wasn't</hi> he mad? He said he would show who was Huck Finn's boss.
        So he watched out for me one day in the spring, and catched me, and
        took me up the river about three mile in a skiff, and crossed over to the
        Illinois shore where it was woody and there warn't no houses but an old
        log hut in a place where the timber was so thick you couldn't find it if
        you didn't know where it was.
      </p>
      <p>
        He kept me with him all the time, and I never got a chance to run off. We
        lived in that old cabin, and he always locked the door and put the key
        under his head nights. He had a gun which he had stole, I <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckon</orig><reg>think</reg></choice></distinct>,
        and we fished and hunted, and that was what we lived on. Every
        little while he locked me in and went down to the store, three miles, to
        the ferry, and traded fish and game for whisky, and fetched it home and
        got drunk and had a good time, and licked me. The widow she found
        out where I was by and by, and she sent a man over to try to get hold of
        me; but pap drove him off with the gun, and it warn't long after that till
        I was used to being where I was, and liked it&#x2014;all but the cowhide
        part.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was kind of lazy and jolly, laying off comfortable all day, smoking and
        fishing, and no books nor study. Two months or more run along, and
        my clothes got to be all rags and dirt, and I didn't see how I'd ever got
        to like it so well at the widow's, where you had to wash, and eat on a
        plate, and comb up, and go to bed and get up regular, and be forever
        bothering over a book, and have old <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_miss_watson">Miss Watson</rs> pecking at you all the
        time. I didn't want to go back no more. I had stopped cussing,
        because the widow didn't like it; but now I took to it again because pap
        hadn't no objections. It was pretty good times up in the woods
        there, take it all around.

        But by and by pap got too handy with his hick'ry, and I couldn't stand it.
        I was all over welts. He got to going away so much, too, and locking
        me in. Once he locked me in and was gone three days. It was
        dreadful lonesome. I judged he had got drownded, and I wasn't ever
        going to get out any more. I was scared. I made up my mind I
        would fix up some way to leave there. I had tried to get out of that
        cabin many a time, but I couldn't find no way. There warn't a window
        to it big enough for a dog to get through. I couldn't get up the
        chimbly; it was too narrow. The door was thick, solid oak slabs.
        <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_pap">Pap</rs> was pretty careful not to leave a knife or anything in the cabin
        when he was away; I <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckon</orig><reg>think</reg></choice></distinct> I had hunted the place over as much as a
        hundred times; well, I was most all the time at it, because it was about
        the only way to put in the time. But this time I found something at
        last; I found an old rusty wood-saw without any handle; it was laid in
        between a rafter and the clapboards of the roof. I greased it up and went
        to work. There was an old horse-blanket nailed against the logs at
        the far end of the cabin behind the table, to keep the wind from blowing
        through the chinks and putting the candle out. I got under the table
        and raised the blanket, and went to work to saw a section of the big
        bottom log out&#x2014;big enough to let me through. Well, it was a
        good long job, but I was getting towards the end of it when I heard pap's
        gun in the woods. I got rid of the signs of my work, and dropped the
        blanket and hid my saw, and pretty soon pap come in.
      </p>
      <p>
        <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_pap">Pap</rs> warn't in a good humor&#x2014;so he was his natural self. He said
        he was down town, and everything was going wrong. His lawyer said he
        <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckoned</orig><reg>thought</reg></choice></distinct> he would win his lawsuit and get the money if they ever got
        started on the trial; but then there was ways to put it off a long time,
        and <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_judge_thatcher">Judge Thatcher</rs> knowed how to do it. And he said people allowed there'd
        be another trial to get me away from him and give me to the widow for my
        guardian, and they guessed it would win this time. This shook me up
        considerable, because I didn't want to go back to the widow's any more and
        be so cramped up and sivilized, as they called it. Then the old man
        got to cussing, and cussed everything and everybody he could think of, and
        then cussed them all over again to make sure he hadn't skipped any, and
        after that he polished off with a kind of a general cuss all round,
        including a considerable parcel of people which he didn't know the names
        of, and so called them what's-his-name when he got to them, and went right
        along with his cussing.
      </p>
      <p>
        He said he would like to see the widow get me. He said he would
        watch out, and if they tried to come any such game on him he knowed of a
        place six or seven mile off to stow me in, where they might hunt till they
        dropped and they couldn't find me. That made me pretty uneasy again,
        but only for a minute; I <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckoned</orig><reg>thought</reg></choice></distinct> I wouldn't stay on hand till he got that
        chance.
      </p>
      <p>
        The old man made me go to the skiff and fetch the things he had got. There
        was a fifty-pound sack of corn meal, and a side of bacon, ammunition, and
        a four-gallon jug of whisky, and an old book and two newspapers for
        wadding, besides some tow. I toted up a load, and went back and set
        down on the bow of the skiff to rest. I thought it all over, and I
        <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckoned</orig><reg>thought</reg></choice></distinct> I would walk off with the gun and some lines, and take to the
        woods when I run away. I guessed I wouldn't stay in one place, but
        just tramp right across the country, mostly night times, and hunt and fish
        to keep alive, and so get so far away that the old man nor the widow
        couldn't ever find me any more. I judged I would saw out and leave
        that night if pap got drunk enough, and I <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckoned</orig><reg>thought</reg></choice></distinct> he would. I got
        so full of it I didn't notice how long I was staying till the old man
        hollered and asked me whether I was asleep or drownded.

        I got the things all up to the cabin, and then it was about dark. While
        I was cooking supper the old man took a swig or two and got sort of warmed
        up, and went to ripping again. He had been drunk over in town, and
        laid in the gutter all night, and he was a sight to look at. <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>A body</orig><reg>Somebody</reg></choice></distinct>
        would a thought he was Adam&#x2014;he was just all mud. Whenever his
        liquor begun to work he most always went for the govment, this time he
        says:
      </p>
      <p>
        "Call this a govment! why, just look at it and see what it's like. Here's
        the law a-standing ready to take a man's son away from him&#x2014;a man's
        own son, which he has had all the trouble and all the anxiety and all the
        expense of raising. Yes, just as that man has got that son raised at
        last, and ready to go to work and begin to do suthin' for <hi rend="italics">him</hi> and give him
        a rest, the law up and goes for him. And they call <hi rend="italics">that</hi> govment!
        That ain't all, nuther. The law backs that old <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_judge_thatcher">Judge Thatcher</rs>
        up and helps him to keep me out o' my property. Here's what the law
        does: The law takes a man worth six thousand dollars and up'ards,
        and jams him into an old trap of a cabin like this, and lets him go round
        in clothes that ain't fitten for a hog. They call that govment! A
        man can't get his rights in a govment like this. Sometimes I've a mighty
        notion to just leave the country for good and all. Yes, and I <hi rend="italics">told</hi> 'em so;
        I told old Thatcher so to his face. Lots of 'em heard me, and can
        tell what I said. Says I, for two cents I'd leave the blamed country
        and never come a-near it agin. <distinct type="l_huck"><choice><orig>them</orig><reg>those</reg></choice></distinct>'s the very words. I says
        look at my hat&#x2014;if you call it a hat&#x2014;but the lid raises up and
        the rest of it goes down till it's below my chin, and then it ain't
        rightly a hat at all, but more like my head was shoved up through a jint
        o' stove-pipe. Look at it, says I&#x2014;such a hat for me to wear&#x2014;one
        of the wealthiest men in this town if I could git my rights.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Oh, yes, this is a wonderful govment, wonderful. Why, looky here.
        There was a free nigger there from Ohio&#x2014;a mulatter, most as white as
        a white man. He had the whitest shirt on you ever see, too, and the
        shiniest hat; and there ain't a man in that town that's got as fine
        clothes as what he had; and he had a gold watch and chain, and a
        silver-headed cane&#x2014;the awfulest old gray-headed nabob in the State.
        And what do you think? They said he was a p'fessor in a
        college, and could talk all kinds of languages, and knowed everything.
        And that ain't the wust. They said he could <hi rend="italics">vote</hi> when he was at
        home. Well, that let me out. Thinks I, what is the country a-coming
        to? It was 'lection day, and I was just about to go and vote myself
        if I warn't too drunk to get there; but when they told me there was a
        State in this country where they'd let that nigger vote, I drawed out.
        I says I'll never vote agin. <distinct type="l_huck"><choice><orig>them</orig><reg>those</reg></choice></distinct>'s the very words I said;
        they all heard me; and the country may rot for all me&#x2014;I'll never
        vote agin as long as I live. And to see the cool way of that nigger&#x2014;why,
        he wouldn't a give me the road if I hadn't shoved him out o' the way.
        I says to the people, why ain't this nigger put up at auction and
        sold?&#x2014;that's what I want to know. And what do you <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckon</orig><reg>think</reg></choice></distinct> they
        said? Why, they said he couldn't be sold till he'd been in the State six
        months, and he hadn't been there that long yet. There, now&#x2014;that's
        a specimen. They call that a govment that can't sell a free nigger
        till he's been in the State six months. Here's a govment that calls
        itself a govment, and lets on to be a govment, and thinks it is a govment,
        and yet's got to set stock-still for six whole months before it can take a
        hold of a prowling, thieving, infernal, white-shirted free nigger, and&#x2014;"
      </p>
      <p>
        <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_pap">Pap</rs> was agoing on so he never noticed where his old limber legs was taking
        him to, so he went head over heels over the tub of salt pork and barked
        both shins, and the rest of his speech was all the hottest kind of
        language&#x2014;mostly hove at the nigger and the govment, though he give
        the tub some, too, all along, here and there. He hopped around the
        cabin considerable, first on one leg and then on the other, holding first
        one shin and then the other one, and at last he let out with his left foot
        all of a sudden and fetched the tub a rattling kick. But it warn't
        good judgment, because that was the boot that had a couple of his toes
        leaking out of the front end of it; so now he raised a howl that fairly
        made <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>a body</orig><reg>somebody</reg></choice></distinct>'s hair raise, and down he went in the dirt, and rolled there,
        and held his toes; and the cussing he done then laid over anything he had
        ever done previous. He said so his own self afterwards. He had
        heard old Sowberry Hagan in his best days, and he said it laid over him,
        too; but I <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckon</orig><reg>think</reg></choice></distinct> that was sort of piling it on, maybe.
      </p>
      <p>
        After supper pap took the jug, and said he had enough whisky there for two
        drunks and one delirium tremens. That was always his word. I
        judged he would be blind drunk in about an hour, and then I would steal
        the key, or saw myself out, one or t'other. He drank and drank, and
        tumbled down on his blankets by and by; but luck didn't run my way. He
        didn't go sound asleep, but was uneasy. He groaned and moaned and
        thrashed around this way and that for a long time. At last I got so
        sleepy I couldn't keep my eyes open all I could do, and so before I knowed
        what I was about I was sound asleep, and the candle burning.
      </p>

      <p>
        I don't know how long I was asleep, but all of a sudden there was an awful
        scream and I was up. There was pap looking wild, and skipping around
        every which way and yelling about snakes. He said they was crawling
        up his legs; and then he would give a jump and scream, and say one had bit
        him on the cheek&#x2014;but I couldn't see no snakes. He started and
        run round and round the cabin, hollering "Take him off! take him off! he's
        biting me on the neck!" I never see a man look so wild in the eyes.
        Pretty soon he was all fagged out, and fell down panting; then he rolled
        over and over wonderful fast, kicking things every which way, and striking
        and grabbing at the air with his hands, and screaming and saying there was
        devils a-hold of him. He wore out by and by, and laid still a while,
        moaning. Then he laid stiller, and didn't make a sound. I
        could hear the owls and the wolves away off in the woods, and it seemed
        terrible still. He was laying over by the corner. By and by he
        raised up part way and listened, with his head to one side. He says,
        very low:
      </p>
      <p>
        "Tramp&#x2014;tramp&#x2014;tramp; that's the dead; tramp&#x2014;tramp&#x2014;tramp;
        they're coming after me; but I won't go. Oh, they're here! don't
        touch me&#x2014;don't! hands off&#x2014;they're cold; let go. Oh, let
        a poor devil alone!"
      </p>
      <p>
        Then he went down on all fours and crawled off, begging them to let him
        alone, and he rolled himself up in his blanket and wallowed in under the
        old pine table, still a-begging; and then he went to crying. I could
        hear him through the blanket.
      </p>
      <p>
        By and by he rolled out and jumped up on his feet looking wild, and he see
        me and went for me. He chased me round and round the place with a
        clasp-knife, calling me the Angel of Death, and saying he would kill me,
        and then I couldn't come for him no more. I begged, and told him I
        was only Huck; but he laughed <hi rend="italics">such</hi> a screechy laugh, and roared and
        cussed, and kept on chasing me up. Once when I turned short and
        dodged under his arm he made a grab and got me by the jacket between my
        shoulders, and I thought I was gone; but I slid out of the jacket quick as
        lightning, and saved myself. Pretty soon he was all tired out, and dropped
        down with his back against the door, and said he would rest a minute and
        then kill me. He put his knife under him, and said he would sleep and get
        strong, and then he would see who was who.
      </p>
      <p>
        So he dozed off pretty soon. By and by I got the old split-bottom
        chair and clumb up as easy as I could, not to make any noise, and got down
        the gun. I slipped the ramrod down it to make sure it was loaded,
        then I laid it across the turnip barrel, pointing towards pap, and set
        down behind it to wait for him to stir. And how slow and still the
        time did drag along.

        CHAPTER VIII.
    </head>
    <p>
      THE sun was up so high when I waked that I judged it was after eight
      o'clock. I laid there in the grass and the cool shade thinking about
      things, and feeling rested and ruther comfortable and satisfied. I
      could see the sun out at one or two holes, but mostly it was big trees all
      about, and gloomy in there amongst them. There was freckled places
      on the ground where the light sifted down through the leaves, and the
      freckled places swapped about a little, showing there was a little breeze
      up there. A couple of squirrels set on a limb and jabbered at me
      very friendly.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was powerful lazy and comfortable&#x2014;didn't want to get up and cook
      breakfast. Well, I was dozing off again when I thinks I hears a deep
      sound of "boom!" away up the river. I rouses up, and rests on my
      elbow and listens; pretty soon I hears it again. I hopped up, and
      went and looked out at a hole in the leaves, and I see a bunch of smoke
      laying on the water a long ways up&#x2014;about abreast the ferry. And
      there was the ferryboat full of people floating along down. I knowed
      what was the matter now. "Boom!" I see the white smoke squirt out of
      the ferryboat's side. You see, they was firing cannon over the
      water, trying to make my carcass come to the top.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was pretty hungry, but it warn't going to do for me to start a fire,
      because they might see the smoke. So I set there and watched the
      cannon-smoke and listened to the boom. The river was a mile wide
      there, and it always looks pretty on a summer morning&#x2014;so I was
      having a good enough time seeing them hunt for my remainders if I only had
      a bite to eat. Well, then I happened to think how they always put
      quicksilver in loaves of bread and float them off, because they always go
      right to the drownded carcass and stop there. So, says I, I'll keep
      a lookout, and if any of <distinct type="l_huck"><choice><orig>them</orig><reg>those</reg></choice></distinct>'s floating around after me I'll give them a
      show. I changed to the Illinois edge of the island to see what luck
      I could have, and I warn't disappointed. A big double loaf come
      along, and I most got it with a long stick, but my foot slipped and she
      floated out further. Of course I was where the current set in the
      closest to the shore&#x2014;I knowed enough for that. But by and by
      along comes another one, and this time I won. I took out the plug
      and shook out the little dab of quicksilver, and set my teeth in. It
      was "baker's bread"&#x2014;what the quality eat; none of your low-down
      corn-pone.
    </p>
    <p>
      I got a good place amongst the leaves, and set there on a log, munching
      the bread and watching the ferry-boat, and very well satisfied. And
      then something struck me. I says, now I <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckon</orig><reg>think</reg></choice></distinct> the widow or the
      parson or somebody prayed that this bread would find me, and here it has
      gone and done it. So there ain't no doubt but there is something in
      that thing&#x2014;that is, there's something in it when <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>a body</orig><reg>somebody</reg></choice></distinct> like the
      widow or the parson prays, but it don't work for me, and I <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckon</orig><reg>think</reg></choice></distinct> it don't
      work for only just the right kind.

      I lit a pipe and had a good long smoke, and went on watching. The
      ferryboat was floating with the current, and I allowed I'd have a chance
      to see who was aboard when she come along, because she would come in
      close, where the bread did. When she'd got pretty well along down
      towards me, I put out my pipe and went to where I fished out the bread,
      and laid down behind a log on the bank in a little open place. Where
      the log forked I could peep through.
    </p>
    <p>
      By and by she come along, and she drifted in so close that they could a
      run out a plank and walked ashore. Most everybody was on the boat.
      <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_pap">Pap</rs>, and <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_judge_thatcher">Judge Thatcher</rs>, and Bessie Thatcher, and Jo Harper, and Tom
      Sawyer, and his old <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_polly">Aunt Polly</rs>, and Sid and Mary, and plenty more. Everybody
      was talking about the murder, but the captain broke in and says:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look sharp, now; the current sets in the closest here, and maybe he's
      washed ashore and got tangled amongst the brush at the water's edge.
      I hope so, anyway."
    </p>
    <p>
      I didn't hope so. They all crowded up and leaned over the rails,
      nearly in my face, and kept still, watching with all their might. I
      could see them first-rate, but they couldn't see me. Then the
      captain sung out:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stand away!" and the cannon let off such a blast right before me that it
      made me deef with the noise and pretty near blind with the smoke, and I
      judged I was gone. If they'd a had some bullets in, I <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckon</orig><reg>think</reg></choice></distinct> they'd
      a got the corpse they was after. Well, I see I warn't hurt, thanks
      to goodness. The boat floated on and went out of sight around the shoulder
      of the island. I could hear the booming now and then, further and
      further off, and by and by, after an hour, I didn't hear it no more.
      The island was three mile long. I judged they had got to the
      foot, and was giving it up. But they didn't yet a while. They
      turned around the foot of the island and started up the channel on the
      Missouri side, under steam, and booming once in a while as they went.
      I crossed over to that side and watched them. When they got abreast
      the head of the island they quit shooting and dropped over to the Missouri
      shore and went home to the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      I knowed I was all right now. Nobody else would come a-hunting after
      me. I got my traps out of the canoe and made me a nice camp in the thick
      woods. I made a kind of a tent out of my blankets to put my things
      under so the rain couldn't get at them. I catched a catfish and
      haggled him open with my saw, and towards sundown I started my camp fire
      and had supper. Then I set out a line to catch some fish for
      breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      When it was dark I set by my camp fire smoking, and feeling pretty well
      satisfied; but by and by it got sort of lonesome, and so I went and set on
      the bank and listened to the current swashing along, and counted the stars
      and drift logs and rafts that come down, and then went to bed; there ain't
      no better way to put in time when you are lonesome; you can't stay so, you
      soon get over it.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so for three days and nights. No difference&#x2014;just the same
      thing. But the next day I went exploring around down through the island.
      I was boss of it; it all belonged to me, so to say, and I wanted to
      know all about it; but mainly I wanted to put in the time. I found
      plenty strawberries, ripe and prime; and green summer grapes, and green
      razberries; and the green blackberries was just beginning to show. They
      would all come handy by and by, I judged.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, I went fooling along in the deep woods till I judged I warn't far
      from the foot of the island. I had my gun along, but I hadn't shot
      nothing; it was for protection; thought I would kill some game nigh home.
      About this time I mighty near stepped on a good-sized snake, and it went
      sliding off through the grass and flowers, and I after it, trying to get a
      shot at it. I clipped along, and all of a sudden I bounded right on to the
      ashes of a camp fire that was still smoking.
    </p>
    <p>
       
    </p>

    <p>
       <lb />
    </p>
    <p>
      My heart jumped up amongst my lungs. I never waited for to look
      further, but uncocked my gun and went sneaking back on my tiptoes as fast
      as ever I could. Every now and then I stopped a second amongst the
      thick leaves and listened, but my breath come so hard I couldn't hear
      nothing else. I slunk along another piece further, then listened
      again; and so on, and so on. If I see a stump, I took it for a man;
      if I trod on a stick and broke it, it made me feel like a person had cut
      one of my breaths in two and I only got half, and the short half, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I got to camp I warn't feeling very brash, there warn't much sand in
      my craw; but I says, this ain't no time to be fooling around. So I
      got all my traps into my canoe again so as to have them out of sight, and
      I put out the fire and scattered the ashes around to look like an old last
      year's camp, and then clumb a tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      I <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckon</orig><reg>think</reg></choice></distinct> I was up in the tree two hours; but I didn't see nothing, I
      didn't hear nothing&#x2014;I only <hi rend="italics">thought</hi> I heard and seen as much as a
      thousand things. Well, I couldn't stay up there forever; so at last
      I got down, but I kept in the thick woods and on the lookout all the time.
      All I could get to eat was berries and what was left over from breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the time it was night I was pretty hungry. So when it was good
      and dark I slid out from shore before moonrise and paddled over to the
      Illinois bank&#x2014;about a quarter of a mile. I went out in the
      woods and cooked a supper, and I had about made up my mind I would stay
      there all night when I hear a <hi rend="italics">plunkety-plunk, plunkety-plunk</hi>, and says to
      myself, horses coming; and next I hear people's voices. I got
      everything into the canoe as quick as I could, and then went creeping
      through the woods to see what I could find out. I hadn't got far
      when I hear a man say:
    </p>
    <p>
      "We better camp here if we can find a good place; the horses is about beat
      out. Let's look around."
    </p>
    <p>
      I didn't wait, but shoved out and paddled away easy. I tied up in
      the old place, and <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckoned</orig><reg>thought</reg></choice></distinct> I would sleep in the canoe.
    </p>
    <p>
      I didn't sleep much. I couldn't, somehow, for thinking. And
      every time I waked up I thought somebody had me by the neck. So the
      sleep didn't do me no good. By and by I says to myself, I can't live
      this way; I'm a-going to find out who it is that's here on the island with
      me; I'll find it out or bust. Well, I felt better right off.
    </p>
    <p>
      So I took my paddle and slid out from shore just a step or two, and then
      let the canoe drop along down amongst the shadows. The moon was
      shining, and outside of the shadows it made it most as light as day.
      I poked along well on to an hour, everything still as rocks and
      sound asleep. Well, by this time I was most down to the foot of the
      island. A little ripply, cool breeze begun to blow, and that was as
      good as saying the night was about done. I give her a turn with the
      paddle and brung her nose to shore; then I got my gun and slipped out and
      into the edge of the woods. I sat down there on a log, and looked
      out through the leaves. I see the moon go off watch, and the
      darkness begin to blanket the river. But in a little while I see a pale
      streak over the treetops, and knowed the day was coming. So I took
      my gun and slipped off towards where I had run across that camp fire,
      stopping every minute or two to listen. But I hadn't no luck
      somehow; I couldn't seem to find the place. But by and by, sure
      enough, I catched a glimpse of fire away through the trees. I went
      for it, cautious and slow. By and by I was close enough to have a
      look, and there laid a man on the ground. It most give me the
      fan-tods. He had a blanket around his head, and his head was nearly in the
      fire. I set there behind a clump of bushes, in about six foot of
      him, and kept my eyes on him steady. It was getting gray daylight
      now. Pretty soon he gapped and stretched himself and hove off the
      blanket, and it was Miss Watson's Jim! I bet I was glad to see him.
      I says:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hello, Jim!" and skipped out.
    </p>
    <p>
      He bounced up and stared at me wild. Then he drops down on his
      knees, and puts his hands together and says:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Doan' hurt me&#x2014;don't! I hain't ever done no harm to a ghos'.
      I alwuz liked dead people, en done all I could for 'em. You go
      en git in de river agin, whah you b'longs, en doan' do nuffn to Ole Jim,
      'at 'uz awluz yo' fren'."
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>
       <lb />
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, I warn't long making him understand I warn't dead. I was ever
      so glad to see <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs>. I warn't lonesome now. I told him I warn't
      afraid of <hi rend="italics">him</hi> telling the people where I was. I talked along, but he
      only set there and looked at me; never said nothing. Then I says:
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's good daylight. Le's get breakfast. Make up your camp
      fire good."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's de use er makin' up de camp fire to cook strawbries en sich truck?
      But you got a gun, hain't you? Den we kin git sumfn better den
      strawbries."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Strawberries and such truck," I says. "Is that what you live on?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I couldn' git nuffn else," he says.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, how long you been on the island, Jim?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I come heah de night arter you's killed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What, all that time?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes&#x2014;indeedy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And ain't you had nothing but that kind of rubbage to eat?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sah&#x2014;nuffn else."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you must be most starved, ain't you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I reck'n I could eat a hoss. I think I could. How long you ben on
      de islan'?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Since the night I got killed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No! W'y, what has you lived on? But you got a gun. Oh,
      yes, you got a gun. Dat's good. Now you kill sumfn en I'll
      make up de fire."
    </p>
    <p>
      So we went over to where the canoe was, and while he built a fire in a
      grassy open place amongst the trees, I fetched meal and bacon and coffee,
      and coffee-pot and frying-pan, and sugar and tin cups, and the nigger was
      set back considerable, because he <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckoned</orig><reg>thought</reg></choice></distinct> it was all done with
      witchcraft. I catched a good big catfish, too, and <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> cleaned him with
      his knife, and fried him.
    </p>
    <p>
      When breakfast was ready we lolled on the grass and eat it smoking hot.
      <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> laid it in with all his might, for he was most about starved. Then
      when we had got pretty well stuffed, we laid off and lazied. By and
      by <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> says:
    </p>
    <p>
      "But looky here, Huck, who wuz it dat 'uz killed in dat shanty ef it
      warn't you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I told him the whole thing, and he said it was smart. He said
      <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom Sawyer</rs>couldn't get up no better plan than what I had. Then I
      says:
    </p>
    <p>
      "How do you come to be here, Jim, and how'd you get here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked pretty uneasy, and didn't say nothing for a minute. Then
      he says:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Maybe I better not tell."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, Jim?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, dey's reasons. But you wouldn' tell on me ef I uz to tell
      you, would you, Huck?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Blamed if I would, <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs>."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I b'lieve you, Huck. I&#x2014;<hi rend="italics">I run off</hi>."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jim!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But mind, you said you wouldn' tell&#x2014;you know you said you wouldn'
      tell, Huck."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I did. I said I wouldn't, and I'll stick to it. Honest
      <hi rend="italics">injun</hi>, I will. People would call me a low-down Abolitionist and
      despise me for keeping mum&#x2014;but that don't make no difference. I
      ain't a-going to tell, and I ain't a-going back there, anyways. So,
      now, le's know all about it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you see, it 'uz dis way. Ole missus&#x2014;dat's Miss Watson&#x2014;she
      pecks on me all de time, en treats me pooty rough, but she awluz said she
      wouldn' sell me down to Orleans. But I noticed dey wuz a nigger
      trader roun' de place considable lately, en I begin to git oneasy. Well,
      one night I creeps to de do' pooty late, en de do' warn't quite shet, en I
      hear old missus tell de widder she gwyne to sell me down to Orleans, but
      she didn' want to, but she could git eight hund'd dollars for me, en it
      'uz sich a big stack o' money she couldn' resis'. De widder she try
      to git her to say she wouldn' do it, but I never waited to hear de res'.
      I lit out mighty quick, I tell you.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I tuck out en shin down de hill, en 'spec to steal a skift 'long de sho'
      som'ers 'bove de town, but dey wuz people a-stirring yit, so I hid in de
      ole tumble-down cooper-shop on de bank to wait for everybody to go 'way.
      Well, I wuz dah all night. Dey wuz somebody roun' all de time.
      'Long 'bout six in de mawnin' skifts begin to go by, en 'bout eight
      er nine every skift dat went 'long wuz talkin' 'bout how yo' pap come over
      to de town en say you's killed. Dese las' skifts wuz full o' ladies
      en genlmen a-goin' over for to see de place. Sometimes dey'd pull up
      at de sho' en take a res' b'fo' dey started acrost, so by de talk I got to
      know all 'bout de killin'. I 'uz powerful sorry you's killed, Huck,
      but I ain't no mo' now.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I laid dah under de shavin's all day. I 'uz hungry, but I warn't
      afeard; bekase I knowed ole missus en de widder wuz goin' to start to de
      camp-meet'n' right arter breakfas' en be gone all day, en dey knows I goes
      off wid de cattle 'bout daylight, so dey wouldn' 'spec to see me roun' de
      place, en so dey wouldn' miss me tell arter dark in de evenin'. De yuther
      servants wouldn' miss me, kase dey'd shin out en take holiday soon as de
      ole folks 'uz out'n de way.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, when it come dark I tuck out up de river road, en went 'bout two
      mile er more to whah dey warn't no houses. I'd made up my mine 'bout
      what I's agwyne to do. You see, ef I kep' on tryin' to git away
      afoot, de dogs 'ud track me; ef I stole a skift to cross over, dey'd miss
      dat skift, you see, en dey'd know 'bout whah I'd lan' on de yuther side,
      en whah to pick up my track. So I says, a raff is what I's arter; it
      doan' <hi rend="italics">make</hi> no track.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see a light a-comin' roun' de p'int bymeby, so I wade' in en shove' a
      log ahead o' me en swum more'n half way acrost de river, en got in 'mongst
      de drift-wood, en kep' my head down low, en kinder swum agin de current
      tell de raff come along. Den I swum to de stern uv it en tuck
      a-holt. It clouded up en 'uz pooty dark for a little while. So
      I clumb up en laid down on de planks. De men 'uz all 'way yonder in
      de middle, whah de lantern wuz. De river wuz a-risin', en dey wuz a
      good current; so I reck'n'd 'at by fo' in de mawnin' I'd be twenty-five
      mile down de river, en den I'd slip in jis b'fo' daylight en swim asho',
      en take to de woods on de Illinois side.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I didn' have no luck. When we 'uz mos' down to de head er de
      islan' a man begin to come aft wid de lantern, I see it warn't no use fer
      to wait, so I slid overboard en struck out fer de islan'. Well, I
      had a notion I could lan' mos' anywhers, but I couldn't&#x2014;bank too
      bluff. I 'uz mos' to de foot er de islan' b'fo' I found' a good
      place. I went into de woods en jedged I wouldn' fool wid raffs no
      mo', long as dey move de lantern roun' so. I had my pipe en a plug
      er dog-leg, en some matches in my cap, en dey warn't wet, so I 'uz all
      right."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And so you ain't had no meat nor bread to eat all this time? Why
      didn't you get mud-turkles?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How you gwyne to git 'm? You can't slip up on um en grab um; en
      how's <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>a body</orig><reg>somebody</reg></choice></distinct> gwyne to hit um wid a rock? How could <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>a body</orig><reg>somebody</reg></choice></distinct> do it in
      de night? En I warn't gwyne to show mysef on de bank in de daytime."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, that's so. You've had to keep in the woods all the time, of
      course. Did you hear 'em shooting the cannon?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes. I knowed dey was arter you. I see um go by heah&#x2014;watched
      um thoo de bushes."
    </p>
    <p>
      Some young birds come along, flying a yard or two at a time and lighting.
      <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> said it was a sign it was going to rain. He said it was a sign
      when young chickens flew that way, and so he <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckoned</orig><reg>thought</reg></choice></distinct> it was the same way
      when young birds done it. I was going to catch some of them, but Jim
      wouldn't let me. He said it was death. He said his father laid
      mighty sick once, and some of them catched a bird, and his old granny said
      his father would die, and he did.
    </p>
    <p>
      And <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> said you mustn't count the things you are going to cook for
      dinner, because that would bring bad luck. The same if you shook the
      table-cloth after sundown. And he said if a man owned a beehive and
      that man died, the bees must be told about it before sun-up next morning,
      or else the bees would all weaken down and quit work and die. Jim
      said bees wouldn't sting idiots; but I didn't believe that, because I had
      tried them lots of times myself, and they wouldn't sting me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had heard about some of these things before, but not all of them. Jim
      knowed all kinds of signs. He said he knowed most everything. I
      said it looked to me like all the signs was about bad luck, and so I asked
      him if there warn't any good-luck signs. He says:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mighty few&#x2014;an' <hi rend="italics">dey</hi> ain't no use to <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>a body</orig><reg>somebody</reg></choice></distinct>. What you want to
      know when good luck's a-comin' for? Want to keep it off?" And
      he said: "Ef you's got hairy arms en a hairy breas', it's a sign dat
      you's agwyne to be rich. Well, dey's some use in a sign like dat, 'kase
      it's so fur ahead. You see, maybe you's got to be po' a long time fust, en
      so you might git discourage' en kill yo'sef 'f you didn' know by de sign
      dat you gwyne to be rich bymeby."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you got hairy arms and a hairy breast, Jim?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's de use to ax dat question? Don't you see I has?"

    </p>
    <p>
      "What did you speculate in, Jim?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, fust I tackled stock."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What kind of stock?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, live stock&#x2014;cattle, you know. I put ten dollars in a cow.
      But I ain' gwyne to resk no mo' money in stock. De cow up 'n'
      died on my han's."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So you lost the ten dollars."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I didn't lose it all. I on'y los' 'bout nine of it. I
      sole de hide en taller for a dollar en ten cents."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You had five dollars and ten cents left. Did you speculate any
      more?"

        CHAPTER IX.
      </head>
      <p>
        I wanted to go and look at a place right about the middle of the island
        that I'd found when I was exploring; so we started and soon got to it,
        because the island was only three miles long and a quarter of a mile wide.
      </p>
      <p>
        This place was a tolerable long, steep hill or ridge about forty foot
        high. We had a rough time getting to the top, the sides was so steep and
        the bushes so thick. We tramped and clumb around all over it, and by
        and by found a good big cavern in the rock, most up to the top on the side
        towards Illinois. The cavern was as big as two or three rooms
        bunched together, and <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> could stand up straight in it. It was cool
        in there. <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> was for putting our traps in there right away, but I said we
        didn't want to be climbing up and down there all the time.
      </p>
      <p>
        <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> said if we had the canoe hid in a good place, and had all the traps in
        the cavern, we could rush there if anybody was to come to the island, and
        they would never find us without dogs. And, besides, he said them
        little birds had said it was going to rain, and did I want the things to
        get wet?
      </p>
      <p>
        So we went back and got the canoe, and paddled up abreast the cavern, and
        lugged all the traps up there. Then we hunted up a place close by to
        hide the canoe in, amongst the thick willows. We took some fish off
        of the lines and set them again, and begun to get ready for dinner.
      </p>
      <p>
        The door of the cavern was big enough to roll a hogshead in, and on one
        side of the door the floor stuck out a little bit, and was flat and a good
        place to build a fire on. So we built it there and cooked dinner.
      </p>
      <p>
        
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
        We spread the blankets inside for a carpet, and eat our dinner in there.
        We put all the other things handy at the back of the cavern. Pretty
        soon it darkened up, and begun to thunder and lighten; so the birds was
        right about it. Directly it begun to rain, and it rained like all
        fury, too, and I never see the wind blow so. It was one of these
        regular summer storms. It would get so dark that it looked all
        blue-black outside, and lovely; and the rain would thrash along by so
        thick that the trees off a little ways looked dim and spider-webby; and
        here would come a blast of wind that would bend the trees down and turn up
        the pale underside of the leaves; and then a perfect ripper of a gust
        would follow along and set the branches to tossing their arms as if they
        was just wild; and next, when it was just about the bluest
        and blackest&#x2014;<hi rend="italics">FST</hi>!
        it was as bright as glory, and you'd have a little glimpse of tree-tops
        a-plunging about away off yonder in the storm, hundreds of yards further
        than you could see before; dark as sin again in a second, and now you'd
        hear the thunder let go with an awful crash, and then go rumbling,
        grumbling, tumbling, down the sky towards the under side of the world,
        like rolling empty barrels down stairs&#x2014;where it's long stairs and
        they bounce a good deal, you know.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Jim, this is nice," I says. "I wouldn't want to be nowhere else but
        here. Pass me along another hunk of fish and some hot corn-bread."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Well, you wouldn't a ben here 'f it hadn't a ben for <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs>. You'd a
        ben down dah in de woods widout any dinner, en gittn' mos' drownded, too;
        dat you would, honey. Chickens knows when it's gwyne to rain, en so
        do de birds, chile."
      </p>
      <p>
        The river went on raising and raising for ten or twelve days, till at last
        it was over the banks. The water was three or four foot deep on the
        island in the low places and on the Illinois bottom. On that side it
        was a good many miles wide, but on the Missouri side it was the same old
        distance across&#x2014;a half a mile&#x2014;because the Missouri shore was
        just a wall of high bluffs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Daytimes we paddled all over the island in the canoe, It was mighty cool
        and shady in the deep woods, even if the sun was blazing outside. We
        went winding in and out amongst the trees, and sometimes the vines hung so
        thick we had to back away and go some other way. Well, on every old
        broken-down tree you could see rabbits and snakes and such things; and
        when the island had been overflowed a day or two they got so tame, on
        account of being hungry, that you could paddle right up and put your hand
        on them if you wanted to; but not the snakes and turtles&#x2014;they would
        slide off in the water. The ridge our cavern was in was full of
        them. We could a had pets enough if we'd wanted them.
      </p>
      <p>
        One night we catched a little section of a lumber raft&#x2014;nice pine
        planks. It was twelve foot wide and about fifteen or sixteen foot long,
        and the top stood above water six or seven inches&#x2014;a solid, level
        floor. We could see saw-logs go by in the daylight sometimes, but we
        let them go; we didn't show ourselves in daylight.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another night when we was up at the head of the island, just before
        daylight, here comes a frame-house down, on the west side. She was a
        two-story, and tilted over considerable. We paddled out and got
        aboard&#x2014;clumb in at an upstairs window. But it was too dark to
        see yet, so we made the canoe fast and set in her to wait for daylight.
      </p>
      <p>
        The light begun to come before we got to the foot of the island. Then
        we looked in at the window. We could make out a bed, and a table,
        and two old chairs, and lots of things around about on the floor, and
        there was clothes hanging against the wall. There was something
        laying on the floor in the far corner that looked like a man. So Jim
        says:
      </p>
      <p>
        "Hello, you!"
      </p>
      <p>
        But it didn't budge. So I hollered again, and then <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> says:
      </p>
      <p>
        "De man ain't asleep&#x2014;he's dead. You hold still&#x2014;I'll go
        en see."
      </p>
      <p>
        He went, and bent down and looked, and says:
      </p>
      <p>
        "It's a dead man. Yes, indeedy; naked, too. He's ben shot in
        de back. I reck'n he's ben dead two er three days. Come in, Huck,
        but doan' look at his face&#x2014;it's too gashly."
      </p>
      <p>
        
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
        I didn't look at him at all. <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> throwed some old rags over him, but
        he needn't done it; I didn't want to see him. There was heaps of old
        greasy cards scattered around over the floor, and old whisky bottles, and
        a couple of masks made out of black cloth; and all over the walls was the
        ignorantest kind of words and pictures made with charcoal. There was
        two old dirty calico dresses, and a sun-bonnet, and some women's
        underclothes hanging against the wall, and some men's clothing, too.
        We put the lot into the canoe&#x2014;it might come good. There
        was a boy's old speckled straw hat on the floor; I took that, too. And
        there was a bottle that had had milk in it, and it had a rag stopper for a
        baby to suck. We would a took the bottle, but it was broke. There
        was a seedy old chest, and an old hair trunk with the hinges broke. They
        stood open, but there warn't nothing left in them that was any account.
        The way things was scattered about we <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckoned</orig><reg>thought</reg></choice></distinct> the people left in a
        hurry, and warn't fixed so as to carry off most of their stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
        We got an old tin lantern, and a butcher-knife without any handle, and a
        bran-new Barlow knife worth two bits in any store, and a lot of tallow
        candles, and a tin candlestick, and a gourd, and a tin cup, and a ratty
        old bedquilt off the bed, and a reticule with needles and pins and beeswax
        and buttons and thread and all such truck in it, and a hatchet and some
        nails, and a fishline as thick as my little finger with some monstrous
        hooks on it, and a roll of buckskin, and a leather dog-collar, and a
        horseshoe, and some vials of medicine that didn't have no label on them;
        and just as we was leaving I found a tolerable good curry-comb, and <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> he
        found a ratty old fiddle-bow, and a wooden leg. The straps was broke
        off of it, but, barring that, it was a good enough leg, though it was too
        long for me and not long enough for Jim, and we couldn't find the other
        one, though we hunted all around.
      </p>
      <p>
        And so, take it all around, we made a good haul. When we was ready
        to shove off we was a quarter of a mile below the island, and it was
        pretty broad day; so I made <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> lay down in the canoe and cover up with
        the quilt, because if he set up people could tell he was a nigger a good
        ways off. I paddled over to the Illinois shore, and drifted down
        most a half a mile doing it. I crept up the dead water under the
        bank, and hadn't no accidents and didn't see nobody. We got home all
        safe.

        CHAPTER X.
      </head>
      <p>
        AFTER breakfast I wanted to talk about the dead man and guess out how he
        come to be killed, but <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> didn't want to. He said it would fetch
        bad luck; and besides, he said, he might come and ha'nt us; he said a man
        that warn't buried was more likely to go a-ha'nting around than one that
        was planted and comfortable. That sounded pretty reasonable, so I
        didn't say no more; but I couldn't keep from studying over it and wishing
        I knowed who shot the man, and what they done it for.
      </p>
      <p>
        We rummaged the clothes we'd got, and found eight dollars in silver sewed
        up in the lining of an old blanket overcoat. <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> said he <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckoned</orig><reg>thought</reg></choice></distinct>
        the people in that house stole the coat, because if they'd a knowed the
        money was there they wouldn't a left it. I said I <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckoned</orig><reg>thought</reg></choice></distinct> they
        killed him, too; but <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> didn't want to talk about that. I says:
      </p>
      <p>
        "Now you think it's bad luck; but what did you say when I fetched in the
        snake-skin that I found on the top of the ridge day before yesterday? You
        said it was the worst bad luck in the world to touch a snake-skin with my
        hands. Well, here's your bad luck! We've raked in all this
        truck and eight dollars besides. I wish we could have some bad luck
        like this every day, <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs>."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Never you mind, honey, never you mind. Don't you git too peart.
        It's a-comin'. Mind I tell you, it's a-comin'."
      </p>
      <p>
        It did come, too. It was a Tuesday that we had that talk. Well,
        after dinner Friday we was laying around in the grass at the upper end of
        the ridge, and got out of tobacco. I went to the cavern to get some,
        and found a rattlesnake in there. I killed him, and curled him up on
        the foot of Jim's blanket, ever so natural, thinking there'd be some fun
        when <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> found him there. Well, by night I forgot all about the
        snake, and when <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> flung himself down on the blanket while I struck a
        light the snake's mate was there, and bit him.
      </p>
      <p>
        He jumped up yelling, and the first thing the light showed was the varmint
        curled up and ready for another spring. I laid him out in a second
        with a stick, and <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> grabbed pap's whisky-jug and begun to pour it down.
      </p>
      <p>
        
      </p>

        <lb />
      </p>
      <p>
        He was barefooted, and the snake bit him right on the heel. That all
        comes of my being such a fool as to not remember that wherever you leave a
        dead snake its mate always comes there and curls around it. <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> told
        me to chop off the snake's head and throw it away, and then skin the body
        and roast a piece of it. I done it, and he eat it and said it would
        help cure him. He made me take off the rattles and tie them around his
        wrist, too. He said that that would help. Then I slid out
        quiet and throwed the snakes clear away amongst the bushes; for I warn't
        going to let <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> find out it was all my fault, not if I could help it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> sucked and sucked at the jug, and now and then he got out of his head
        and pitched around and yelled; but every time he come to himself he went
        to sucking at the jug again. His foot swelled up pretty big, and so
        did his leg; but by and by the drunk begun to come, and so I judged he was
        all right; but I'd druther been bit with a snake than pap's whisky.
      </p>
      <p>
        <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> was laid up for four days and nights. Then the swelling was all
        gone and he was around again. I made up my mind I wouldn't ever take
        a-holt of a snake-skin again with my hands, now that I see what had come
        of it. <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> said he <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckoned</orig><reg>thought</reg></choice></distinct> I would believe him next time. And he
        said that handling a snake-skin was such awful bad luck that maybe we
        hadn't got to the end of it yet. He said he druther see the new moon
        over his left shoulder as much as a thousand times than take up a
        snake-skin in his hand. Well, I was getting to feel that way myself,
        though I've always <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckoned</orig><reg>thought</reg></choice></distinct> that looking at the new moon over your left
        shoulder is one of the carelessest and foolishest things <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>a body</orig><reg>somebody</reg></choice></distinct> can do.
        Old Hank Bunker done it once, and bragged about it; and in less than
        two years he got drunk and fell off of the shot-tower, and spread himself
        out so that he was just a kind of a layer, as you may say; and they slid
        him edgeways between two barn doors for a coffin, and buried him so, so
        they say, but I didn't see it. <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_pap">Pap</rs> told me. But anyway it all
        come of looking at the moon that way, like a fool.

        Well, the days went along, and the river went down between its banks
        again; and about the first thing we done was to bait one of the big hooks
        with a skinned rabbit and set it and catch a catfish that was as big as a
        man, being six foot two inches long, and weighed over two hundred pounds.
        We couldn't handle him, of course; he would a flung us into Illinois.
        We just set there and watched him rip and tear around till he
        drownded. We found a brass button in his stomach and a round ball,
        and lots of rubbage. We split the ball open with the hatchet, and
        there was a spool in it. <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> said he'd had it there a long time, to
        coat it over so and make a ball of it. It was as big a fish as was
        ever catched in the Mississippi, I <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckon</orig><reg>think</reg></choice></distinct>. <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> said he hadn't ever
        seen a bigger one. He would a been worth a good deal over at the
        village. They peddle out such a fish as that by the pound in the
        market-house there; everybody buys some of him; his meat's as white as
        snow and makes a good fry.
      </p>
      <p>
        Next morning I said it was getting slow and dull, and I wanted to get a
        stirring up some way. I said I <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckoned</orig><reg>thought</reg></choice></distinct> I would slip over the river
        and find out what was going on. <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> liked that notion; but he said I
        must go in the dark and look sharp. Then he studied it over and
        said, couldn't I put on some of <distinct type="l_huck"><choice><orig>them</orig><reg>those</reg></choice></distinct> old things and dress up like a girl?
        That was a good notion, too. So we shortened up one of the
        calico gowns, and I turned up my trouser-legs to my knees and got into it.
        <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> hitched it behind with the hooks, and it was a fair fit. I
        put on the sun-bonnet and tied it under my chin, and then for <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>a body</orig><reg>somebody</reg></choice></distinct> to
        look in and see my face was like looking down a joint of stove-pipe.
        <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> said nobody would know me, even in the daytime, hardly. I
        practiced around all day to get the hang of the things, and by and by I
        could do pretty well in them, only <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> said I didn't walk like a girl; and
        he said I must quit pulling up my gown to get at my britches-pocket.
        I took notice, and done better.

        I started up the Illinois shore in the canoe just after dark.
      </p>
      <p>
        I started across to the town from a little below the ferry-landing, and
        the drift of the current fetched me in at the bottom of the town. I
        tied up and started along the bank. There was a light burning in a
        little shanty that hadn't been lived in for a long time, and I wondered
        who had took up quarters there. I slipped up and peeped in at the
        window. There was a woman about forty year old in there knitting by
        a candle that was on a pine table. I didn't know her face; she was a
        stranger, for you couldn't start a face in that town that I didn't know.
        Now this was lucky, because I was weakening; I was getting afraid I
        had come; people might know my voice and find me out. But if this
        woman had been in such a little town two days she could tell me all I
        wanted to know; so I knocked at the door, and made up my mind I wouldn't
        forget I was a girl.

        CHAPTER XI.

    <p>
      "COME in," says the woman, and I did. She says: "Take a
      cheer."
    </p>
    <p>
      I done it. She looked me all over with her little shiny eyes, and
      says:
    </p>
    <p>
      "What might your name be?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sarah Williams."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where 'bouts do you live? In this neighborhood?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "No'm. In Hookerville, seven mile below. I've walked all the
      way and I'm all tired out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hungry, too, I <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckon</orig><reg>think</reg></choice></distinct>. I'll find you something."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No'm, I ain't hungry. I was so hungry I had to stop two miles below
      here at a farm; so I ain't hungry no more. It's what makes me so
      late. My mother's down sick, and out of money and everything, and I come
      to tell my uncle Abner Moore. He lives at the upper end of the town,
      she says. I hain't ever been here before. Do you know him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; but I don't know everybody yet. I haven't lived here quite two
      weeks. It's a considerable ways to the upper end of the town. You
      better stay here all night. Take off your bonnet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," I says; "I'll rest a while, I <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckon</orig><reg>think</reg></choice></distinct>, and go on. I ain't
      afeared of the dark."
    </p>
    <p>
      She said she wouldn't let me go by myself, but her husband would be in by
      and by, maybe in a hour and a half, and she'd send him along with me. Then
      she got to talking about her husband, and about her relations up the
      river, and her relations down the river, and about how much better off
      they used to was, and how they didn't know but they'd made a mistake
      coming to our town, instead of letting well alone&#x2014;and so on and so
      on, till I was afeard I had made a mistake coming to her to find out what
      was going on in the town; but by and by she dropped on to pap and the
      murder, and then I was pretty willing to let her clatter right along.
      She told about me and <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom Sawyer</rs>finding the six thousand dollars
      (only she got it ten) and all about pap and what a hard lot he was, and
      what a hard lot I was, and at last she got down to where I was murdered.
      I says:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who done it? We've heard considerable about these goings on down in
      Hookerville, but we don't know who 'twas that killed Huck Finn."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckon</orig><reg>think</reg></choice></distinct> there's a right smart chance of people <hi rend="italics">here</hi> that'd like to
      know who killed him. Some think old Finn done it himself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No&#x2014;is that so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Most everybody thought it at first. He'll never know how nigh he
      come to getting lynched. But before night they changed around and
      judged it was done by a runaway nigger named <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs>."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why <hi rend="italics">he</hi>&#x2014;"
    </p>
    <p>
      I stopped. I <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckoned</orig><reg>thought</reg></choice></distinct> I better keep still. She run on, and
      never noticed I had put in at all:
    </p>
    <p>
      "The nigger run off the very night Huck Finn was killed. So there's
      a reward out for him&#x2014;three hundred dollars. And there's a
      reward out for old Finn, too&#x2014;two hundred dollars. You see, he
      come to town the morning after the murder, and told about it, and was out
      with 'em on the ferryboat hunt, and right away after he up and left.
      Before night they wanted to lynch him, but he was gone, you see.
      Well, next day they found out the nigger was gone; they found out he
      hadn't ben seen sence ten o'clock the night the murder was done. So
      then they put it on him, you see; and while they was full of it, next day,
      back comes old Finn, and went boo-hooing to <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_judge_thatcher">Judge Thatcher</rs> to get money to
      hunt for the nigger all over Illinois with. The judge gave him some, and
      that evening he got drunk, and was around till after midnight with a
      couple of mighty hard-looking strangers, and then went off with them.
      Well, he hain't come back sence, and they ain't looking for him back
      till this thing blows over a little, for people thinks now that he killed
      his boy and fixed things so folks would think robbers done it, and then
      he'd get Huck's money without having to bother a long time with a lawsuit.
      People do say he warn't any too good to do it. Oh, he's sly, I
      <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckon</orig><reg>think</reg></choice></distinct>. If he don't come back for a year he'll be all right. You
      can't prove anything on him, you know; everything will be quieted down
      then, and he'll walk in Huck's money as easy as nothing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckon</orig><reg>think</reg></choice></distinct> so, 'm. I don't see nothing in the way of it. Has
      everybody quit thinking the nigger done it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no, not everybody. A good many thinks he done it. But
      they'll get the nigger pretty soon now, and maybe they can scare it out of
      him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, are they after him yet?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you're innocent, ain't you! Does three hundred dollars lay
      around every day for people to pick up? Some folks think the nigger
      ain't far from here. I'm one of them&#x2014;but I hain't talked it
      around. A few days ago I was talking with an old couple that lives
      next door in the log shanty, and they happened to say hardly anybody ever
      goes to that island over yonder that they call Jackson's Island. Don't
      anybody live there? says I. No, nobody, says they. I didn't say any
      more, but I done some thinking. I was pretty near certain I'd seen
      smoke over there, about the head of the island, a day or two before that,
      so I says to myself, like as not that nigger's hiding over there; anyway,
      says I, it's worth the trouble to give the place a hunt. I hain't
      seen any smoke sence, so I <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckon</orig><reg>think</reg></choice></distinct> maybe he's gone, if it was him; but
      husband's going over to see&#x2014;him and another man. He was gone
      up the river; but he got back to-day, and I told him as soon as he got
      here two hours ago."

      I had got so uneasy I couldn't set still. I had to do something with
      my hands; so I took up a needle off of the table and went to threading it.
      My hands shook, and I was making a bad job of it. When the woman
      stopped talking I looked up, and she was looking at me pretty curious and
      smiling a little. I put down the needle and thread, and let on to be
      interested&#x2014;and I was, too&#x2014;and says:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Three hundred dollars is a power of money. I wish my mother could
      get it. Is your husband going over there to-night?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes. He went up-town with the man I was telling you of, to get
      a boat and see if they could borrow another gun. They'll go over
      after midnight."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Couldn't they see better if they was to wait till daytime?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. And couldn't the nigger see better, too? After midnight
      he'll likely be asleep, and they can slip around through the woods and
      hunt up his camp fire all the better for the dark, if he's got one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I didn't think of that."
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman kept looking at me pretty curious, and I didn't feel a bit
      comfortable. Pretty soon she says,
    </p>
    <p>
      "What did you say your name was, honey?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "M&#x2014;Mary Williams."
    </p>
    <p>
      Somehow it didn't seem to me that I said it was Mary before, so I didn't
      look up&#x2014;seemed to me I said it was Sarah; so I felt sort of
      cornered, and was afeared maybe I was looking it, too. I wished the
      woman would say something more; the longer she set still the uneasier I
      was. But now she says:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Honey, I thought you said it was Sarah when you first come in?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes'm, I did. Sarah Mary Williams. Sarah's my first name.
      Some calls me Sarah, some calls me Mary."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, that's the way of it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes'm."
    </p>
    <p>
      I was feeling better then, but I wished I was out of there, anyway. I
      couldn't look up yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, the woman fell to talking about how hard times was, and how poor
      they had to live, and how the rats was as free as if they owned the place,
      and so forth and so on, and then I got easy again. She was right
      about the rats. You'd see one stick his nose out of a hole in the corner
      every little while. She said she had to have things handy to throw
      at them when she was alone, or they wouldn't give her no peace. She
      showed me a bar of lead twisted up into a knot, and said she was a good
      shot with it generly, but she'd wrenched her arm a day or two ago, and
      didn't know whether she could throw true now. But she watched for a
      chance, and directly banged away at a rat; but she missed him wide, and
      said "Ouch!" it hurt her arm so. Then she told me to try for the
      next one. I wanted to be getting away before the old man got back,
      but of course I didn't let on. I got the thing, and the first rat
      that showed his nose I let drive, and if he'd a stayed where he was he'd a
      been a tolerable sick rat. She said that was first-rate, and she
      <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckoned</orig><reg>thought</reg></choice></distinct> I would hive the next one. She went and got the lump of
      lead and fetched it back, and brought along a hank of yarn which she
      wanted me to help her with. I held up my two hands and she put the
      hank over them, and went on talking about her and her husband's matters.
      But she broke off to say:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Keep your eye on the rats. You better have the lead in your lap,
      handy."
    </p>
    <p>
      So she dropped the lump into my lap just at that moment, and I clapped my
      legs together on it and she went on talking. But only about a
      minute. Then she took off the hank and looked me straight in the face, and
      very pleasant, and says:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, now, what's your real name?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wh&#x2014;what, mum?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's your real name? Is it Bill, or Tom, or Bob?&#x2014;or what is
      it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      I <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckon</orig><reg>think</reg></choice></distinct> I shook like a leaf, and I didn't know hardly what to do. But
      I says:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Please to don't poke fun at a poor girl like me, mum. If I'm in the
      way here, I'll&#x2014;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, you won't. Set down and stay where you are. I ain't going
      to hurt you, and I ain't going to tell on you, nuther. You just tell
      me your secret, and trust me. I'll keep it; and, what's more, I'll
      help you. So'll my old man if you want him to. You see, you're a
      runaway 'prentice, that's all. It ain't anything. There ain't
      no harm in it. You've been treated bad, and you made up your mind to cut.
      Bless you, child, I wouldn't tell on you. Tell me all about it
      now, that's a good boy."
    </p>
    <p>
      So I said it wouldn't be no use to try to play it any longer, and I would
      just make a clean breast and tell her everything, but she musn't go back
      on her promise. Then I told her my father and mother was dead, and
      the law had bound me out to a mean old farmer in the country thirty mile
      back from the river, and he treated me so bad I couldn't stand it no
      longer; he went away to be gone a couple of days, and so I took my chance
      and stole some of his daughter's old clothes and cleared out, and I had
      been three nights coming the thirty miles. I traveled nights, and
      hid daytimes and slept, and the bag of bread and meat I carried from home
      lasted me all the way, and I had a-plenty. I said I believed my
      uncle Abner Moore would take care of me, and so that was why I struck out
      for this town of Goshen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Goshen, child? This ain't Goshen. This is St. Petersburg.
      Goshen's ten mile further up the river. Who told you this was
      Goshen?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, a man I met at daybreak this morning, just as I was going to turn
      into the woods for my regular sleep. He told me when the roads
      forked I must take the right hand, and five mile would fetch me to
      Goshen."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He was drunk, I <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckon</orig><reg>think</reg></choice></distinct>. He told you just exactly wrong."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, he did act like he was drunk, but it ain't no matter now. I
      got to be moving along. I'll fetch Goshen before daylight."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hold on a minute. I'll put you up a snack to eat. You might
      want it."
    </p>
    <p>
       
    </p>
    <figure>
      <graphic url="media/c11-90.jpg" /><lb />
    </figure>
    <p>
       <lb />
    </p>
    <p>
      So she put me up a snack, and says:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say, when a cow's laying down, which end of her gets up first? Answer
      up prompt now&#x2014;don't stop to study over it. Which end gets up
      first?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The hind end, mum."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, then, a horse?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The for'rard end, mum."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Which side of a tree does the moss grow on?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "North side."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If fifteen cows is browsing on a hillside, how many of <distinct type="l_huck"><choice><orig>them</orig><reg>those</reg></choice></distinct> eats with
      their heads pointed the same direction?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The whole fifteen, mum."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckon</orig><reg>think</reg></choice></distinct> you <hi rend="italics">have</hi> lived in the country. I thought maybe you
      was trying to hocus me again. What's your real name, now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "George Peters, mum."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, try to remember it, George. Don't forget and tell me it's
      Elexander before you go, and then get out by saying it's George Elexander
      when I catch you. And don't go about women in that old calico.
      You do a girl tolerable poor, but you might fool men, maybe. Bless
      you, child, when you set out to thread a needle don't hold the thread
      still and fetch the needle up to it; hold the needle still and poke the
      thread at it; that's the way a woman most always does, but a man always
      does t'other way. And when you throw at a rat or anything, hitch
      yourself up a tiptoe and fetch your hand up over your head as awkward as
      you can, and miss your rat about six or seven foot. Throw stiff-armed from
      the shoulder, like there was a pivot there for it to turn on, like a girl;
      not from the wrist and elbow, with your arm out to one side, like a boy.
      And, mind you, when a girl tries to catch anything in her lap she
      throws her knees apart; she don't clap them together, the way you did when
      you catched the lump of lead. Why, I spotted you for a boy when you
      was threading the needle; and I contrived the other things just to make
      certain. Now trot along to your uncle, Sarah Mary Williams George
      Elexander Peters, and if you get into trouble you send word to Mrs. Judith
      Loftus, which is me, and I'll do what I can to get you out of it. Keep
      the river road all the way, and next time you tramp take shoes and socks
      with you. The river road's a rocky one, and your feet'll be in a condition
      when you get to Goshen, I <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckon</orig><reg>think</reg></choice></distinct>."

    <p>
      I went up the bank about fifty yards, and then I doubled on my tracks and
      slipped back to where my canoe was, a good piece below the house. I
      jumped in, and was off in a hurry. I went up-stream far enough to
      make the head of the island, and then started across. I took off the
      sun-bonnet, for I didn't want no blinders on then. When I was about
      the middle I heard the clock begin to strike, so I stops and listens; the
      sound come faint over the water but clear&#x2014;eleven. When I
      struck the head of the island I never waited to blow, though I was most
      winded, but I shoved right into the timber where my old camp used to be,
      and started a good fire there on a high and dry spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I jumped in the canoe and dug out for our place, a mile and a half
      below, as hard as I could go. I landed, and slopped through the
      timber and up the ridge and into the cavern. There <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> laid, sound
      asleep on the ground. I roused him out and says:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Git up and hump yourself, Jim! There ain't a minute to lose. They're
      after us!"
    </p>

    <p>
      <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> never asked no questions, he never said a word; but the way he worked
      for the next half an hour showed about how he was scared. By that
      time everything we had in the world was on our raft, and she was ready to
      be shoved out from the willow cove where she was hid. We put out the
      camp fire at the cavern the first thing, and didn't show a candle outside
      after that.
    </p>
    <p>
      I took the canoe out from the shore a little piece, and took a look; but
      if there was a boat around I couldn't see it, for stars and shadows ain't
      good to see by. Then we got out the raft and slipped along down in
      the shade, past the foot of the island dead still&#x2014;never saying a
      word.

    <p>
      IT must a been close on to one o'clock when we got below the island at
      last, and the raft did seem to go mighty slow. If a boat was to come
      along we was going to take to the canoe and break for the Illinois shore;
      and it was well a boat didn't come, for we hadn't ever thought to put the
      gun in the canoe, or a fishing-line, or anything to eat. We was in
      ruther too much of a sweat to think of so many things. It warn't
      good judgment to put <hi rend="italics">everything</hi> on the raft.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the men went to the island I just expect they found the camp fire I
      built, and watched it all night for <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> to come. Anyways, they
      stayed away from us, and if my building the fire never fooled them it
      warn't no fault of mine. I played it as low down on them as I could.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the first streak of day began to show we tied up to a towhead in a
      big bend on the Illinois side, and hacked off cottonwood branches with the
      hatchet, and covered up the raft with them so she looked like there had
      been a cave-in in the bank there. A tow-head is a sandbar that has
      cottonwoods on it as thick as harrow-teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had mountains on the Missouri shore and heavy timber on the Illinois
      side, and the channel was down the Missouri shore at that place, so we
      warn't afraid of anybody running across us. We laid there all day,
      and watched the rafts and steamboats spin down the Missouri shore, and
      up-bound steamboats fight the big river in the middle. I told Jim
      all about the time I had jabbering with that woman; and <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> said she was a
      smart one, and if she was to start after us herself she wouldn't set down
      and watch a camp fire&#x2014;no, sir, she'd fetch a dog. Well, then,
      I said, why couldn't she tell her husband to fetch a dog? <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> said
      he bet she did think of it by the time the men was ready to start, and he
      believed they must a gone up-town to get a dog and so they lost all that
      time, or else we wouldn't be here on a towhead sixteen or seventeen mile
      below the village&#x2014;no, indeedy, we would be in that same old town
      again. So I said I didn't care what was the reason they didn't get
      us as long as they didn't.
    </p>
    <p>
      When it was beginning to come on dark we poked our heads out of the
      cottonwood thicket, and looked up and down and across; nothing in sight;
      so <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> took up some of the top planks of the raft and built a snug wigwam
      to get under in blazing weather and rainy, and to keep the things dry. Jim
      made a floor for the wigwam, and raised it a foot or more above the level
      of the raft, so now the blankets and all the traps was out of reach of
      steamboat waves. Right in the middle of the wigwam we made a layer
      of dirt about five or six inches deep with a frame around it for to hold
      it to its place; this was to build a fire on in sloppy weather or chilly;
      the wigwam would keep it from being seen. We made an extra
      steering-oar, too, because one of the others might get broke on a snag or
      something. We fixed up a short forked stick to hang the old lantern on,
      because we must always light the lantern whenever we see a steamboat
      coming down-stream, to keep from getting run over; but we wouldn't have to
      light it for up-stream boats unless we see we was in what they call a
      "crossing"; for the river was pretty high yet, very low banks being still
      a little under water; so up-bound boats didn't always run the channel, but
      hunted easy water.
    </p>
    <p>
      This second night we run between seven and eight hours, with a current
      that was making over four mile an hour. We catched fish and talked,
      and we took a swim now and then to keep off sleepiness. It was kind
      of solemn, drifting down the big, still river, laying on our backs looking
      up at the stars, and we didn't ever feel like talking loud, and it warn't
      often that we laughed&#x2014;only a little kind of a low chuckle. We
      had mighty good weather as a general thing, and nothing ever happened to
      us at all&#x2014;that night, nor the next, nor the next.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every night we passed towns, some of them away up on black hillsides,
      nothing but just a shiny bed of lights; not a house could you see. The
      fifth night we passed St. Louis, and it was like the whole world lit up.
      In St. Petersburg they used to say there was twenty or thirty thousand
      people in St. Louis, but I never believed it till I see that wonderful
      spread of lights at two o'clock that still night. There warn't a
      sound there; everybody was asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every night now I used to slip ashore towards ten o'clock at some little
      village, and buy ten or fifteen cents' worth of meal or bacon or other
      stuff to eat; and sometimes I lifted a chicken that warn't roosting
      comfortable, and took him along. <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_pap">Pap</rs> always said, take a chicken
      when you get a chance, because if you don't want him yourself you can easy
      find somebody that does, and a good deed ain't ever forgot. I never
      see pap when he didn't want the chicken himself, but that is what he used
      to say, anyway.

      Mornings before daylight I slipped into cornfields and borrowed a
      watermelon, or a mushmelon, or a punkin, or some new corn, or things of
      that kind. <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_pap">Pap</rs> always said it warn't no harm to borrow things if you
      was meaning to pay them back some time; but the widow said it warn't
      anything but a soft name for stealing, and no decent body would do it.
      <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> said he <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckoned</orig><reg>thought</reg></choice></distinct> the widow was partly right and pap was partly
      right; so the best way would be for us to pick out two or three things
      from the list and say we wouldn't borrow them any more&#x2014;then he
      <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckoned</orig><reg>thought</reg></choice></distinct> it wouldn't be no harm to borrow the others. So we talked
      it over all one night, drifting along down the river, trying to make up
      our minds whether to drop the watermelons, or the cantelopes, or the
      mushmelons, or what. But towards daylight we got it all settled
      satisfactory, and concluded to drop crabapples and p'simmons. We
      warn't feeling just right before that, but it was all comfortable now.
      I was glad the way it come out, too, because crabapples ain't ever
      good, and the p'simmons wouldn't be ripe for two or three months yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      We shot a water-fowl now and then that got up too early in the morning or
      didn't go to bed early enough in the evening. Take it all round, we
      lived pretty high.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fifth night below St. Louis we had a big storm after midnight, with a
      power of thunder and lightning, and the rain poured down in a solid sheet.
      We stayed in the wigwam and let the raft take care of itself. When the
      lightning glared out we could see a big straight river ahead, and high,
      rocky bluffs on both sides. By and by says I, "Hel-<hi rend="italics">lo</hi>, Jim, looky
      yonder!" It was a steamboat that had killed herself on a rock. We
      was drifting straight down for her. The lightning showed her very
      distinct. She was leaning over, with part of her upper deck above
      water, and you could see every little chimbly-guy clean and clear, and a
      chair by the big bell, with an old slouch hat hanging on the back of it,
      when the flashes come.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, it being away in the night and stormy, and all so mysterious-like, I
      felt just the way any other boy would a felt when I see that wreck laying
      there so mournful and lonesome in the middle of the river. I wanted
      to get aboard of her and slink around a little, and see what there was
      there. So I says:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Le's land on her, <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs>."
    </p>
    <p>
      But <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> was dead against it at first. He says:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I doan' want to go fool'n 'long er no wrack. We's doin' blame'
      well, en we better let blame' well alone, as de good book says. Like
      as not dey's a watchman on dat wrack."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Watchman your grandmother," I says; "there ain't nothing to watch but the
      texas and the pilot-house; and do you <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckon</orig><reg>think</reg></choice></distinct> anybody's going to resk his
      life for a texas and a pilot-house such a night as this, when it's likely
      to break up and wash off down the river any minute?" <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> couldn't
      say nothing to that, so he didn't try. "And besides," I says, "we
      might borrow something worth having out of the captain's stateroom. Seegars,
      I bet you&#x2014;and cost five cents apiece, solid cash. Steamboat
      captains is always rich, and get sixty dollars a month, and <hi rend="italics">they</hi> don't
      care a cent what a thing costs, you know, long as they want it. Stick
      a candle in your pocket; I can't rest, Jim, till we give her a rummaging.
      Do you <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckon</orig><reg>think</reg></choice></distinct> <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom Sawyer</rs>would ever go by this thing? Not for
      pie, he wouldn't. He'd call it an adventure&#x2014;that's what he'd call
      it; and he'd land on that wreck if it was his last act. And wouldn't
      he throw style into it?&#x2014;wouldn't he spread himself, nor nothing?
      Why, you'd think it was Christopher C'lumbus discovering
      Kingdom-Come. I wish <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom Sawyer</rs><hi rend="italics">was</hi> here."
    </p>
    <p>
      <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> he grumbled a little, but give in. He said we mustn't talk any
      more than we could help, and then talk mighty low. The lightning
      showed us the wreck again just in time, and we fetched the stabboard
      derrick, and made fast there.
    </p>
    <p>
      The deck was high out here. We went sneaking down the slope of it to
      labboard, in the dark, towards the texas, feeling our way slow with our
      feet, and spreading our hands out to fend off the guys, for it was so dark
      we couldn't see no sign of them. Pretty soon we struck the forward
      end of the skylight, and clumb on to it; and the next step fetched us in
      front of the captain's door, which was open, and by Jimminy, away down
      through the texas-hall we see a light! and all in the same second we seem
      to hear low voices in yonder!
    </p>
    <p>
      <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> whispered and said he was feeling powerful sick, and told me to come
      along. I says, all right, and was going to start for the raft; but
      just then I heard a voice wail out and say:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, please don't, boys; I swear I won't ever tell!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Another voice said, pretty loud:
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a lie, <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> Turner. You've acted this way before. You
      always want more'n your share of the truck, and you've always got it, too,
      because you've swore 't if you didn't you'd tell. But this time
      you've said it jest one time too many. You're the meanest,
      treacherousest hound in this country."
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> was gone for the raft. I was just a-biling with
      curiosity; and I says to myself, <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom Sawyer</rs>wouldn't back out now, and so
      I won't either; I'm a-going to see what's going on here. So I
      dropped on my hands and knees in the little passage, and crept aft in the
      dark till there warn't but one stateroom betwixt me and the cross-hall of
      the texas. Then in there I see a man stretched on the floor and tied
      hand and foot, and two men standing over him, and one of them had a dim
      lantern in his hand, and the other one had a pistol. This one kept
      pointing the pistol at the man's head on the floor, and saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'd <hi rend="italics">like</hi> to! And I orter, too&#x2014;a mean skunk!"
    </p>
    <p>
       
    </p>
    <figure>
      <graphic url="media/c12-098.jpg" /><lb />
    </figure>
    <p>
       <lb />
    </p>
    <p>
      The man on the floor would shrivel up and say, "Oh, please don't, Bill; I
      hain't ever goin' to tell."
    </p>
    <p>
      And every time he said that the man with the lantern would laugh and say:
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Deed you <hi rend="italics">ain't!</hi> You never said no truer thing 'n that, you bet
      you." And once he said: "Hear him beg! and yit if we hadn't got the
      best of him and tied him he'd a killed us both. And what <hi rend="italics">for</hi>? Jist
      for noth'n. Jist because we stood on our <hi rend="italics">rights</hi>&#x2014;that's what for.
      But I lay you ain't a-goin' to threaten nobody any more, <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> Turner.
      Put <hi rend="italics">up</hi> that pistol, Bill."
    </p>
    <p>
      Bill says:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't want to, Jake Packard. I'm for killin' him&#x2014;and didn't
      he kill old Hatfield jist the same way&#x2014;and don't he deserve it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I don't <hi rend="italics">want</hi> him killed, and I've got my reasons for it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bless yo' heart for <distinct type="l_huck"><choice><orig>them</orig><reg>those</reg></choice></distinct> words, Jake Packard! I'll never forgit you
      long's I live!" says the man on the floor, sort of blubbering.
    </p>
    <p>
      Packard didn't take no notice of that, but hung up his lantern on a nail
      and started towards where I was there in the dark, and motioned Bill to
      come. I crawfished as fast as I could about two yards, but the boat
      slanted so that I couldn't make very good time; so to keep from getting
      run over and catched I crawled into a stateroom on the upper side. The
      man came a-pawing along in the dark, and when Packard got to my stateroom,
      he says:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here&#x2014;come in here."
    </p>
    <p>
      And in he come, and Bill after him. But before they got in I was up
      in the upper berth, cornered, and sorry I come. Then they stood
      there, with their hands on the ledge of the berth, and talked. I
      couldn't see them, but I could tell where they was by the whisky they'd
      been having. I was glad I didn't drink whisky; but it wouldn't made
      much difference anyway, because most of the time they couldn't a treed me
      because I didn't breathe. I was too scared. And, besides, a
      body <hi rend="italics">couldn't</hi> breathe and hear such talk. They talked low and
      earnest. Bill wanted to kill Turner. He says:
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's said he'll tell, and he will. If we was to give both our
      shares to him <hi rend="italics">now</hi> it wouldn't make no difference after the row and the way
      we've served him. Shore's you're born, he'll turn State's evidence;
      now you hear <hi rend="italics">me</hi>. I'm for putting him out of his troubles."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So'm I," says Packard, very quiet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Blame it, I'd sorter begun to think you wasn't. Well, then, that's
      all right. Le's go and do it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hold on a minute; I hain't had my say yit. You listen to me.
      Shooting's good, but there's quieter ways if the thing's <hi rend="italics">got</hi> to be done.
      But what I say is this: it ain't good sense to go court'n around
      after a halter if you can git at what you're up to in some way that's jist
      as good and at the same time don't bring you into no resks. Ain't
      that so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You bet it is. But how you goin' to manage it this time?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, my idea is this: we'll rustle around and gather up whatever
      pickins we've overlooked in the staterooms, and shove for shore and hide
      the truck. Then we'll wait. Now I say it ain't a-goin' to be more'n
      two hours befo' this wrack breaks up and washes off down the river. See?
      He'll be drownded, and won't have nobody to blame for it but his own self.
      I <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckon</orig><reg>think</reg></choice></distinct> that's a considerble sight better 'n killin' of him. I'm
      unfavorable to killin' a man as long as you can git aroun' it; it ain't
      good sense, it ain't good morals. Ain't I right?"
    </p>
    <p>
       
    </p>
    <figure>
      <graphic url="media/c12-100.jpg" /><lb />
    </figure>
    <p>
       <lb />
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I reck'n you are. But s'pose she <hi rend="italics">don't</hi> break up and wash off?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, we can wait the two hours anyway and see, can't we?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right, then; come along."
    </p>
    <p>
      So they started, and I lit out, all in a cold sweat, and scrambled
      forward. It was dark as pitch there; but I said, in a kind of a coarse
      whisper, "Jim!" and he answered up, right at my elbow, with a sort of a
      moan, and I says:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quick, Jim, it ain't no time for fooling around and moaning; there's a
      gang of murderers in yonder, and if we don't hunt up their boat and set
      her drifting down the river so these fellows can't get away from the wreck
      there's one of 'em going to be in a bad fix. But if we find their

      THE news was all over town in two minutes, and you could see the people
      tearing down on the run from every which way, some of them putting on
      their coats as they come. Pretty soon we was in the middle of a
      crowd, and the noise of the tramping was like a soldier march. The
      windows and dooryards was full; and every minute somebody would say, over
      a fence:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Is it <hi rend="italics">them</hi>?"
    </p>
   <p>
      And somebody trotting along with the gang would answer back and say:
    </p>
   <p>
      "You bet it is."
    </p>
   <p>
      When we got to the house the street in front of it was packed, and the
      three girls was standing in the door. Mary Jane <hi rend="italics">was</hi> red-headed, but
      that don't make no difference, she was most awful beautiful, and her face
      and her eyes was all lit up like glory, she was so glad her uncles was
      come. The king he spread his arms, and Mary Jane she jumped for them, and
      the hare-lip jumped for the duke, and there they had it! Everybody
      most, leastways women, cried for joy to see them meet again at last and
      have such good times.
    </p>
   <p>
      Then the king he hunched <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_the_duke">the duke</rs> private—I see him do it—and
      then he looked around and see the coffin, over in the corner on two
      chairs; so then him and the duke, with a hand across each other's
      shoulder, and t'other hand to their eyes, walked slow and solemn over
      there, everybody dropping back to give them room, and all the talk and
      noise stopping, people saying "Sh!" and all the men taking their hats off
      and drooping their heads, so you could a heard a pin fall. And when
      they got there they bent over and looked in the coffin, and took one
      sight, and then they bust out a-crying so you could a heard them to
      Orleans, most; and then they put their arms around each other's necks, and
      hung their chins over each other's shoulders; and then for three minutes,
      or maybe four, I never see two men leak the way they done. And, mind
      you, everybody was doing the same; and the place was that damp I never see
      anything like it. Then one of them got on one side of the coffin, and
      t'other on t'other side, and they kneeled down and rested their foreheads
      on the coffin, and let on to pray all to themselves. Well, when it
      come to that it worked the crowd like you never see anything like it, and
      everybody broke down and went to sobbing right out loud—the poor
      girls, too; and every woman, nearly, went up to the girls, without saying
      a word, and kissed them, solemn, on the forehead, and then put their hand
      on their head, and looked up towards the sky, with the tears running down,
      and then busted out and went off sobbing and swabbing, and give the next
      woman a show. I never see anything so disgusting.
    </p>

   <p>
      Well, by and by the king he gets up and comes forward a little, and works
      himself up and slobbers out a speech, all full of tears and flapdoodle
      about its being a sore trial for him and his poor brother to lose the
      diseased, and to miss seeing diseased alive after the long journey of four
      thousand mile, but it's a trial that's sweetened and sanctified to us by
      this dear sympathy and these holy tears, and so he thanks them out of his
      heart and out of his brother's heart, because out of their mouths they
      can't, words being too weak and cold, and all that kind of rot and slush,
      till it was just sickening; and then he blubbers out a pious goody-goody
      Amen, and turns himself loose and goes to crying fit to bust.
    </p>
   <p>
      And the minute the words were out of his mouth somebody over in the crowd
      struck up the doxolojer, and everybody joined in with all their might, and
      it just warmed you up and made you feel as good as church letting out.
      Music is a good thing; and after all that soul-butter and hogwash I never
      see it freshen up things so, and sound so honest and bully.
    </p>
   <p>
      Then the king begins to work his jaw again, and says how him and his
      nieces would be glad if a few of the main principal friends of the family
      would take supper here with them this evening, and help set up with the
      ashes of the diseased; and says if his poor brother laying yonder could
      speak he knows who he would name, for they was names that was very dear to
      him, and mentioned often in his letters; and so he will name the same, to
      wit, as follows, vizz.:—Rev. Mr. Hobson, and Deacon Lot Hovey, and
      Mr. Ben Rucker, and Abner Shackleford, and Levi Bell, and Dr. Robinson,
      and their wives, and the widow Bartley.
    </p>
   <p>
      Rev. Hobson and Dr. Robinson was down to the end of the town a-hunting
      together—that is, I mean the doctor was shipping a sick man to
      t'other world, and the preacher was pinting him right. Lawyer Bell
      was away up to Louisville on business. But the rest was on hand, and
      so they all come and shook hands with the king and thanked him and talked
      to him; and then they shook hands with <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_the_duke">the duke</rs> and didn't say nothing,
      but just kept a-smiling and bobbing their heads like a passel of sapheads
      whilst he made all sorts of signs with his hands and said "Goo-goo—goo-goo-goo"
      all the time, like a baby that can't talk.
    </p>
   <p>
      So the king he blattered along, and managed to inquire about pretty much
      everybody and dog in town, by his name, and mentioned all sorts of little
      things that happened one time or another in the town, or to George's
      family, or to Peter. And he always let on that Peter wrote him the
      things; but that was a lie: he got every blessed one of them out of
      that young flathead that we canoed up to the steamboat.
    </p>
   <p>
      Then Mary Jane she fetched the letter her father left behind, and the king
      he read it out loud and cried over it. It give the dwelling-house
      and three thousand dollars, gold, to the girls; and it give the tanyard
      (which was doing a good business), along with some other houses and land
      (worth about seven thousand), and three thousand dollars in gold to Harvey
      and William, and told where the six thousand cash was hid down cellar.
      So these two frauds said they'd go and fetch it up, and have
      everything square and above-board; and told me to come with a candle.
      We shut the cellar door behind us, and when they found the bag they
      spilt it out on the floor, and it was a lovely sight, all <distinct type="l_huck"><choice><orig>them</orig><reg>those</reg></choice></distinct>
      yaller-boys. My, the way the king's eyes did shine! He slaps
      <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_the_duke">the duke</rs> on the shoulder and says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Oh, <hi rend="italics">this</hi> ain't bully nor noth'n! Oh, no, I <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckon</orig><reg>think</reg></choice></distinct> not! Why,
      <hi rend="italics">bully</hi>, it beats the Nonesuch, <hi rend="italics">don't</hi> it?"
    </p>
   <p>
      <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_the_duke">The duke</rs> allowed it did. They pawed the yaller-boys, and sifted them
      through their fingers and let them jingle down on the floor; and the king
      says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "It ain't no use talkin'; bein' brothers to a rich dead man and
      representatives of furrin heirs that's got left is the line for you and
      me, Bilge. Thish yer comes of trust'n to Providence. It's the
      best way, in the long run. I've tried 'em all, and ther' ain't no
      better way."
    </p>
   <p>
      Most everybody would a been satisfied with the pile, and took it on trust;
      but no, they must count it. So they counts it, and it comes out four
      hundred and fifteen dollars short. Says the king:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Dern him, I wonder what he done with that four hundred and fifteen
      dollars?"
    </p>
   <p>
      They worried over that awhile, and ransacked all around for it. Then
      <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_the_duke">the duke</rs> says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Well, he was a pretty sick man, and likely he made a mistake—I
      <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckon</orig><reg>think</reg></choice></distinct> that's the way of it. The best way's to let it go, and keep
      still about it. We can spare it."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Oh, shucks, yes, we can <hi rend="italics">spare</hi> it. I don't k'yer noth'n 'bout that—it's
      the <hi rend="italics">count</hi> I'm thinkin' about. We want to be awful square and open
      and above-board here, you know. We want to lug this h-yer money up
      stairs and count it before everybody—then ther' ain't noth'n
      suspicious. But when the dead man says ther's six thous'n dollars,
      you know, we don't want to—"
    </p>
   <p>
      "Hold on," says <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_the_duke">the duke</rs>. "Le's make up the deffisit," and he begun
      to haul out yaller-boys out of his pocket.
    </p>

    </p>
   <p>
      "It's a most amaz'n' good idea, duke—you <hi rend="italics">have</hi> got a rattlin' clever
      head on you," says the king. "Blest if the old Nonesuch ain't a
      heppin' us out agin," and <hi rend="italics">he</hi> begun to haul out yaller-jackets and stack
      them up.
    </p>
   <p>
      It most busted them, but they made up the six thousand clean and clear.
    </p>
   <p>
      "Say," says the duke, "I got another idea. Le's go up stairs and
      count this money, and then take and <hi rend="italics">give it to the girls</hi>."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Good land, duke, lemme hug you! It's the most dazzling idea 'at
      ever a man struck. You have cert'nly got the most astonishin' head I
      ever see. Oh, this is the boss dodge, ther' ain't no mistake 'bout it.
      Let 'em fetch along their suspicions now if they want to—this
      'll lay 'em out."
    </p>
   <p>
      When we got up-stairs everybody gethered around the table, and the king he
      counted it and stacked it up, three hundred dollars in a pile—twenty
      elegant little piles. Everybody looked hungry at it, and licked
      their chops. Then they raked it into the bag again, and I see the
      king begin to swell himself up for another speech. He says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Friends all, my poor brother that lays yonder has done generous by them
      that's left behind in the vale of sorrers. He has done generous by
      these yer poor little lambs that he loved and sheltered, and that's left
      fatherless and motherless. Yes, and we that knowed him knows that he
      would a done <hi rend="italics">more</hi> generous by 'em if he hadn't ben afeard o' woundin' his
      dear William and me. Now, <hi rend="italics">wouldn't</hi> he? Ther' ain't no question
      'bout it in <hi rend="italics">my</hi> mind. Well, then, what kind o' brothers would it be
      that 'd stand in his way at sech a time? And what kind o' uncles
      would it be that 'd rob—yes, <hi rend="italics">rob</hi>—sech poor sweet lambs as
      these 'at he loved so at sech a time? If I know William—and I
      <hi rend="italics">think</hi> I do—he—well, I'll jest ask him." He turns around and
      begins to make a lot of signs to <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_the_duke">the duke</rs> with his hands, and <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_the_duke">the duke</rs> he
      looks at him stupid and leather-headed a while; then all of a sudden he
      seems to catch his meaning, and jumps for the king, goo-gooing with all
      his might for joy, and hugs him about fifteen times before he lets up.
      Then the king says, "I knowed it; I <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckon</orig><reg>think</reg></choice></distinct> <hi rend="italics">that 'll</hi> convince anybody
      the way <hi rend="italics">he</hi> feels about it. Here, Mary Jane, Susan, Joanner, take the
      money—take it <hi rend="italics">all</hi>. It's the gift of him that lays yonder, cold
      but joyful."
    </p>
   <p>
        
    </p>

      <lb/>

   <p>
       <lb/>
    </p>
   <p>
      Mary Jane she went for him, Susan and the hare-lip went for the duke, and
      then such another hugging and kissing I never see yet. And everybody
      crowded up with the tears in their eyes, and most shook the hands off of
      them frauds, saying all the time:
    </p>
   <p>
      "You <hi rend="italics">dear</hi> good souls!—how <hi rend="italics">lovely</hi>!—how <hi rend="italics">could</hi> you!"
    </p>
   <p>
      Well, then, pretty soon all hands got to talking about the diseased again,
      and how good he was, and what a loss he was, and all that; and before long
      a big iron-jawed man worked himself in there from outside, and stood
      a-listening and looking, and not saying anything; and nobody saying
      anything to him either, because the king was talking and they was all busy
      listening. The king was saying—in the middle of something he'd
      started in on—
    </p>
   <p>
      "—they bein' partickler friends o' the diseased. That's why
      they're invited here this evenin'; but tomorrow we want <hi rend="italics">all</hi> to come—everybody;
      for he respected everybody, he liked everybody, and so it's fitten that
      his funeral orgies sh'd be public."
    </p>
   <p>
      And so he went a-mooning on and on, liking to hear himself talk, and every
      little while he fetched in his funeral orgies again, till <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_the_duke">the duke</rs> he
      couldn't stand it no more; so he writes on a little scrap of paper,
      "<hi rend="italics">Obsequies</hi>, you old fool," and folds it up, and goes to goo-gooing and
      reaching it over people's heads to him. The king he reads it and
      puts it in his pocket, and says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Poor William, afflicted as he is, his <hi rend="italics">heart's</hi> aluz right. Asks me
      to invite everybody to come to the funeral—wants me to make 'em all
      welcome. But he needn't a worried—it was jest what I was at."
    </p>
   <p>
      Then he weaves along again, perfectly ca'm, and goes to dropping in his
      funeral orgies again every now and then, just like he done before. And
      when he done it the third time he says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "I say orgies, not because it's the common term, because it ain't—obsequies
      bein' the common term—but because orgies is the right term.
      Obsequies ain't used in England no more now—it's gone out. We
      say orgies now in England. Orgies is better, because it means the
      thing you're after more exact. It's a word that's made up out'n the
      Greek <hi rend="italics">orgo</hi>, outside, open, abroad; and the Hebrew <hi rend="italics">jeesum</hi>, to plant, cover
      up; hence in<hi rend="italics">ter.</hi> So, you see, funeral orgies is an open er public
      funeral."
    </p>
   <p>
      He was the <hi rend="italics">worst</hi> I ever struck. Well, the iron-jawed man he laughed
      right in his face. Everybody was shocked. Everybody says,
      "Why, <hi rend="italics">doctor</hi>!" and Abner Shackleford says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Why, Robinson, hain't you heard the news? This is Harvey Wilks."
    </p>
   <p>
      The king he smiled eager, and shoved out his flapper, and says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Is it my poor brother's dear good friend and physician? I—"
    </p>
   <p>
      "Keep your hands off of me!" says the doctor. "<hi rend="italics">You</hi> talk like an
      Englishman, <hi rend="italics">don't</hi> you? It's the worst imitation I ever heard. <hi rend="italics">You</hi>
      Peter Wilks's brother! You're a fraud, that's what you are!"
    </p>
   <p>
        
    </p>
   <figure>
      <graphic url="media/c25-218.jpg"/>
      <lb/>
    </figure>
   <p>
       <lb/>
    </p>
   <p>
      Well, how they all took on! They crowded around the doctor and tried
      to quiet him down, and tried to explain to him and tell him how Harvey 'd
      showed in forty ways that he <hi rend="italics">was</hi> Harvey, and knowed everybody by name, and
      the names of the very dogs, and begged and <hi rend="italics">begged</hi> him not to hurt Harvey's
      feelings and the poor girl's feelings, and all that. But it warn't
      no use; he stormed right along, and said any man that pretended to be an
      Englishman and couldn't imitate the lingo no better than what he did was a
      fraud and a liar. The poor girls was hanging to the king and crying;
      and all of a sudden the doctor ups and turns on <hi rend="italics">them</hi>. He says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "I was your father's friend, and I'm your friend; and I warn you as a
      friend, and an honest one that wants to protect you and keep you out of
      harm and trouble, to turn your backs on that scoundrel and have nothing to
      do with him, the ignorant tramp, with his idiotic Greek and Hebrew, as he
      calls it. He is the thinnest kind of an impostor—has come here
      with a lot of empty names and facts which he picked up somewheres, and you
      take them for <hi rend="italics">proofs</hi>, and are helped to fool yourselves by these foolish
      friends here, who ought to know better. Mary Jane Wilks, you know me
      for your friend, and for your unselfish friend, too. Now listen to
      me; turn this pitiful rascal out—I <hi rend="italics">beg</hi> you to do it. Will
      you?"
    </p>
   <p>
      Mary Jane straightened herself up, and my, but she was handsome! She
      says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "<hi rend="italics">Here</hi> is my answer." She hove up the bag of money and put it in the
      king's hands, and says, "Take this six thousand dollars, and invest for me
      and my sisters any way you want to, and don't give us no receipt for it."
    </p>
   <p>
      Then she put her arm around the king on one side, and Susan and the
      hare-lip done the same on the other. Everybody clapped their hands
      and stomped on the floor like a perfect storm, whilst the king held up his
      head and smiled proud. The doctor says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "All right; I wash <hi rend="italics">my</hi> hands of the matter. But I warn you all that a
      time 's coming when you're going to feel sick whenever you think of this
      day." And away he went.
    </p>
   <p>
      "All right, doctor," says the king, kinder mocking him; "we'll try and get
      'em to send for you;" which made them all laugh, and they said it was a
      prime good hit.

   <p>
      WELL, when they was all gone the king he asks Mary Jane how they was off
      for spare rooms, and she said she had one spare room, which would do for
      Uncle William, and she'd give her own room to Uncle Harvey, which was a
      little bigger, and she would turn into the room with her sisters and sleep
      on a cot; and up garret was a little cubby, with a pallet in it. The king
      said the cubby would do for his valley—meaning me.
    </p>
   <p>
      So Mary Jane took us up, and she showed them their rooms, which was plain
      but nice. She said she'd have her frocks and a lot of other traps
      took out of her room if they was in Uncle Harvey's way, but he said they
      warn't. The frocks was hung along the wall, and before them was a
      curtain made out of calico that hung down to the floor. There was an
      old hair trunk in one corner, and a guitar-box in another, and all sorts
      of little knickknacks and jimcracks around, like girls brisken up a room
      with. The king said it was all the more homely and more pleasanter
      for these fixings, and so don't disturb them. The duke's room was
      pretty small, but plenty good enough, and so was my cubby.
    </p>
   <p>
      That night they had a big supper, and all them men and women was there,
      and I stood behind the king and the duke's chairs and waited on them, and
      the niggers waited on the rest. Mary Jane she set at the head of the
      table, with Susan alongside of her, and said how bad the biscuits was, and
      how mean the preserves was, and how ornery and tough the fried chickens
      was—and all that kind of rot, the way women always do for to force
      out compliments; and the people all knowed everything was tiptop, and said
      so—said "How <hi rend="italics">do</hi> you get biscuits to brown so nice?" and "Where, for
      the land's sake, <hi rend="italics">did</hi> you get these amaz'n pickles?" and all that kind of
      humbug talky-talk, just the way people always does at a supper, you know.

   <p>
      And when it was all done me and the hare-lip had supper in the kitchen off
      of the leavings, whilst the others was helping the niggers clean up the
      things. The hare-lip she got to pumping me about England, and blest
      if I didn't think the ice was getting mighty thin sometimes. She
      says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Did you ever see the king?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "Who? William Fourth? Well, I bet I have—he goes to our
      church." I knowed he was dead years ago, but I never let on. So
      when I says he goes to our church, she says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "What—regular?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "Yes—regular. His pew's right over opposite ourn—on
      t'other side the pulpit."
    </p>
   <p>
      "I thought he lived in London?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "Well, he does. Where <hi rend="italics">would</hi> he live?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "But I thought <hi rend="italics">you</hi> lived in Sheffield?"
    </p>
   <p>
      I see I was up a stump. I had to let on to get choked with a chicken
      bone, so as to get time to think how to get down again. Then I says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "I mean he goes to our church regular when he's in Sheffield. That's
      only in the summer time, when he comes there to take the sea baths."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Why, how you talk—Sheffield ain't on the sea."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Well, who said it was?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "Why, you did."
    </p>
   <p>
      "I <hi rend="italics">didn't</hi> nuther."
    </p>
   <p>
      "You did!"
    </p>
   <p>
      "I didn't."
    </p>
   <p>
      "You did."
    </p>
   <p>
      "I never said nothing of the kind."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Well, what <hi rend="italics">did</hi> you say, then?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "Said he come to take the sea <hi rend="italics">baths</hi>—that's what I said."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Well, then, how's he going to take the sea baths if it ain't on the sea?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "Looky here," I says; "did you ever see any Congress-water?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Well, did you have to go to Congress to get it?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "Why, no."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Well, neither does William Fourth have to go to the sea to get a sea
      bath."
    </p>
   <p>
      "How does he get it, then?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "Gets it the way people down here gets Congress-water—in barrels.
      There in the palace at Sheffield they've got furnaces, and he wants
      his water hot. They can't bile that amount of water away off there
      at the sea. They haven't got no conveniences for it."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Oh, I see, now. You might a said that in the first place and saved
      time."
    </p>
   <p>
      When she said that I see I was out of the woods again, and so I was
      comfortable and glad. Next, she says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Do you go to church, too?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "Yes—regular."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Where do you set?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "Why, in our pew."
    </p>
   <p>
      "<hi rend="italics">Whose</hi> pew?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "Why, <hi rend="italics">ourn</hi>—your Uncle Harvey's."
    </p>
   <p>
      "His'n? What does <hi rend="italics">he</hi> want with a pew?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "Wants it to set in. What did you <hi rend="italics"><distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckon</orig><reg>think</reg></choice></distinct></hi> he wanted with it?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "Why, I thought he'd be in the pulpit."
    </p>
   <p>
      Rot him, I forgot he was a preacher. I see I was up a stump again,
      so I played another chicken bone and got another think. Then I says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Blame it, do you suppose there ain't but one preacher to a church?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "Why, what do they want with more?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "What!—to preach before a king? I never did see such a girl as
      you. They don't have no less than seventeen."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Seventeen! My land! Why, I wouldn't set out such a string as
      that, not if I <hi rend="italics">never</hi> got to glory. It must take 'em a week."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Shucks, they don't <hi rend="italics">all</hi> of 'em preach the same day—only <hi rend="italics">one</hi> of 'em."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Well, then, what does the rest of 'em do?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "Oh, nothing much. Loll around, pass the plate—and one thing
      or another. But mainly they don't do nothing."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Well, then, what are they <hi rend="italics">for</hi>?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "Why, they're for <hi rend="italics">style</hi>. Don't you know nothing?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "Well, I don't <hi rend="italics">want</hi> to know no such foolishness as that. How is
      servants treated in England? Do they treat 'em better 'n we treat
      our niggers?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "<hi rend="italics">No</hi>! A servant ain't nobody there. They treat them worse than
      dogs."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Don't they give 'em holidays, the way we do, Christmas and New Year's
      week, and Fourth of July?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "Oh, just listen! <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>A body</orig><reg>Somebody</reg></choice></distinct> could tell <hi rend="italics">you</hi> hain't ever been to England
      by that. Why, Hare-l—why, Joanna, they never see a holiday
      from year's end to year's end; never go to the circus, nor theater, nor
      nigger shows, nor nowheres."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Nor church?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "Nor church."
    </p>
   <p>
      "But <hi rend="italics">you</hi> always went to church."
    </p>
   <p>
      Well, I was gone up again. I forgot I was the old man's servant.
      But next minute I whirled in on a kind of an explanation how a
      valley was different from a common servant and <hi rend="italics">had</hi> to go to church whether
      he wanted to or not, and set with the family, on account of its being the
      law. But I didn't do it pretty good, and when I got done I see she
      warn't satisfied. She says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Honest injun, now, hain't you been telling me a lot of lies?"
    </p>
   <p>
        
    </p>
   <figure>
      <graphic url="media/c26-224.jpg"/>
      <lb/>
    </figure>
   <p>
       <lb/>
    </p>
   <p>
      "Honest injun," says I.
    </p>
   <p>
      "None of it at all?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "None of it at all. Not a lie in it," says I.
    </p>
   <p>
      "Lay your hand on this book and say it."
    </p>
   <p>
      I see it warn't nothing but a dictionary, so I laid my hand on it and said
      it. So then she looked a little better satisfied, and says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Well, then, I'll believe some of it; but I hope to gracious if I'll
      believe the rest."
    </p>
   <p>
      "What is it you won't believe, Joe?" says Mary Jane, stepping in with
      Susan behind her. "It ain't right nor kind for you to talk so to
      him, and him a stranger and so far from his people. How would you
      like to be treated so?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "That's always your way, Maim—always sailing in to help somebody
      before they're hurt. I hain't done nothing to him. He's told
      some stretchers, I <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckon</orig><reg>think</reg></choice></distinct>, and I said I wouldn't swallow it all; and
      that's every bit and grain I <hi rend="italics">did</hi> say. I <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckon</orig><reg>think</reg></choice></distinct> he can stand a little
      thing like that, can't he?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "I don't care whether 'twas little or whether 'twas big; he's here in our
      house and a stranger, and it wasn't good of you to say it. If you
      was in his place it would make you feel ashamed; and so you oughtn't to
      say a thing to another person that will make <hi rend="italics">them</hi> feel ashamed."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Why, Mam, he said—"
    </p>
   <p>
      "It don't make no difference what he <hi rend="italics">said</hi>—that ain't the thing.
      The thing is for you to treat him <hi rend="italics">kind</hi>, and not be saying things to
      make him remember he ain't in his own country and amongst his own folks."
    </p>
   <p>
      I says to myself, <hi rend="italics">this</hi> is a girl that I'm letting that old reptile rob her
      of her money!
    </p>
   <p>
      Then Susan <hi rend="italics">she</hi> waltzed in; and if you'll believe me, she did give Hare-lip
      hark from the tomb!
    </p>
   <p>
      Says I to myself, and this is <hi rend="italics">another</hi> one that I'm letting him rob her of
      her money!
    </p>
   <p>
      Then Mary Jane she took another inning, and went in sweet and lovely again—which
      was her way; but when she got done there warn't hardly anything left o'
      poor Hare-lip. So she hollered.
    </p>
   <p>
      "All right, then," says the other girls; "you just ask his pardon."
    </p>
   <p>
      She done it, too; and she done it beautiful. She done it so
      beautiful it was good to hear; and I wished I could tell her a thousand
      lies, so she could do it again.
    </p>
   <p>
      I says to myself, this is <hi rend="italics">another</hi> one that I'm letting him rob her of her
      money. And when she got through they all jest laid theirselves out
      to make me feel at home and know I was amongst friends. I felt so
      ornery and low down and mean that I says to myself, my mind's made up;
      I'll hive that money for them or bust.
    </p>
   <p>
      So then I lit out—for bed, I said, meaning some time or another.
      When I got by myself I went to thinking the thing over. I says
      to myself, shall I go to that doctor, private, and blow on these frauds?
      No—that won't do. He might tell who told him; then the king
      and <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_the_duke">the duke</rs> would make it warm for me. Shall I go, private, and
      tell Mary Jane? No—I dasn't do it. Her face would give them a
      hint, sure; they've got the money, and they'd slide right out and get away
      with it. If she was to fetch in help I'd get mixed up in the
      business before it was done with, I judge. No; there ain't no good
      way but one. I got to steal that money, somehow; and I got to steal
      it some way that they won't suspicion that I done it. They've got a good
      thing here, and they ain't a-going to leave till they've played this
      family and this town for all they're worth, so I'll find a chance time
      enough. I'll steal it and hide it; and by and by, when I'm away down the
      river, I'll write a letter and tell Mary Jane where it's hid. But I
      better hive it tonight if I can, because the doctor maybe hasn't let up as
      much as he lets on he has; he might scare them out of here yet.
    </p>
   <p>
      So, thinks I, I'll go and search <distinct type="l_huck"><choice><orig>them</orig><reg>those</reg></choice></distinct> rooms. Upstairs the hall was
      dark, but I found the duke's room, and started to paw around it with my
      hands; but I recollected it wouldn't be much like the king to let anybody
      else take care of that money but his own self; so then I went to his room
      and begun to paw around there. But I see I couldn't do nothing
      without a candle, and I dasn't light one, of course. So I judged I'd
      got to do the other thing—lay for them and eavesdrop. About
      that time I hears their footsteps coming, and was going to skip under the
      bed; I reached for it, but it wasn't where I thought it would be; but I
      touched the curtain that hid Mary Jane's frocks, so I jumped in behind
      that and snuggled in amongst the gowns, and stood there perfectly still.
    </p>

       <lb/>
    </p>
   <p>
      They come in and shut the door; and the first thing <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_the_duke">the duke</rs> done was to
      get down and look under the bed. Then I was glad I hadn't found the
      bed when I wanted it. And yet, you know, it's kind of natural to
      hide under the bed when you are up to anything private. They sets
      down then, and the king says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Well, what is it? And cut it middlin' short, because it's better
      for us to be down there a-whoopin' up the mournin' than up here givin' 'em
      a chance to talk us over."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Well, this is it, Capet. I ain't easy; I ain't comfortable. That
      doctor lays on my mind. I wanted to know your plans. I've got
      a notion, and I think it's a sound one."
    </p>
   <p>
      "What is it, duke?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "That we better glide out of this before three in the morning, and clip it
      down the river with what we've got. Specially, seeing we got it so
      easy—<hi rend="italics">given</hi> back to us, flung at our heads, as you may say, when of
      course we allowed to have to steal it back. I'm for knocking off and
      lighting out."
    </p>
   <p>
      That made me feel pretty bad. About an hour or two ago it would a
      been a little different, but now it made me feel bad and disappointed, The
      king rips out and says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "What! And not sell out the rest o' the property? March off
      like a passel of fools and leave eight or nine thous'n' dollars' worth o'
      property layin' around jest sufferin' to be scooped in?—and all
      good, salable stuff, too."
    </p>
   <p>
      <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_the_duke">The duke</rs> he grumbled; said the bag of gold was enough, and he didn't want
      to go no deeper—didn't want to rob a lot of orphans of <hi rend="italics">everything</hi>
      they had.
    </p>
   <p>
      "Why, how you talk!" says the king. "We sha'n't rob 'em of nothing
      at all but jest this money. The people that <hi rend="italics">buys</hi> the property is the
      suff'rers; because as soon 's it's found out 'at we didn't own it—which
      won't be long after we've slid—the sale won't be valid, and it 'll
      all go back to the estate. These yer orphans 'll git their house
      back agin, and that's enough for <hi rend="italics">them</hi>; they're young and spry, and k'n
      easy earn a livin'. <hi rend="italics">they</hi> ain't a-goin to suffer. Why, jest
      think—there's thous'n's and thous'n's that ain't nigh so well off.
      Bless you, <hi rend="italics">they</hi> ain't got noth'n' to complain of."
    </p>
   <p>
      Well, the king he talked him blind; so at last he give in, and said all
      right, but said he believed it was blamed foolishness to stay, and that
      doctor hanging over them. But the king says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Cuss the doctor! What do we k'yer for <hi rend="italics">him</hi>? Hain't we got all
      the fools in town on our side? And ain't that a big enough majority
      in any town?"
    </p>
   <p>
      So they got ready to go down stairs again. <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_the_duke">The duke</rs> says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "I don't think we put that money in a good place."
    </p>
   <p>
      That cheered me up. I'd begun to think I warn't going to get a hint
      of no kind to help me. The king says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Why?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "Because Mary Jane 'll be in mourning from this out; and first you know
      the nigger that does up the rooms will get an order to box these duds up
      and put 'em away; and do you <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckon</orig><reg>think</reg></choice></distinct> a nigger can run across money and not
      borrow some of it?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "Your head's level agin, duke," says the king; and he comes a-fumbling
      under the curtain two or three foot from where I was. I stuck tight
      to the wall and kept mighty still, though quivery; and I wondered what
     <distinct type="l_huck"><choice><orig>them</orig><reg>those</reg></choice></distinct> fellows would say to me if they catched me; and I tried to think what
      I'd better do if they did catch me. But the king he got the bag
      before I could think more than about a half a thought, and he never
      suspicioned I was around. They took and shoved the bag through a rip
      in the straw tick that was under the feather-bed, and crammed it in a foot
      or two amongst the straw and said it was all right now, because a nigger
      only makes up the feather-bed, and don't turn over the straw tick only
      about twice a year, and so it warn't in no danger of getting stole now.

   <p>
      But I knowed better. I had it out of there before they was half-way
      down stairs. I groped along up to my cubby, and hid it there till I
      could get a chance to do better. I judged I better hide it outside
      of the house somewheres, because if they missed it they would give the
      house a good ransacking: I knowed that very well. Then I
      turned in, with my clothes all on; but I couldn't a gone to sleep if I'd a
      wanted to, I was in such a sweat to get through with the business. By
      and by I heard the king and <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_the_duke">the duke</rs> come up; so I rolled off my pallet
      and laid with my chin at the top of my ladder, and waited to see if
      anything was going to happen. But nothing did.
    </p>
   <p>
      So I held on till all the late sounds had quit and the early ones hadn't
      begun yet; and then I slipped down the ladder.

   <p>
      I crept to their doors and listened; they was snoring. So I tiptoed
      along, and got down stairs all right. There warn't a sound
      anywheres. I peeped through a crack of the dining-room door, and see
      the men that was watching the corpse all sound asleep on their chairs.
      The door was open into the parlor, where the corpse was laying, and
      there was a candle in both rooms. I passed along, and the parlor door was
      open; but I see there warn't nobody in there but the remainders of Peter;
      so I shoved on by; but the front door was locked, and the key wasn't
      there. Just then I heard somebody coming down the stairs, back
      behind me. I run in the parlor and took a swift look around, and the
      only place I see to hide the bag was in the coffin. The lid was
      shoved along about a foot, showing the dead man's face down in there, with
      a wet cloth over it, and his shroud on. I tucked the money-bag in
      under the lid, just down beyond where his hands was crossed, which made me
      creep, they was so cold, and then I run back across the room and in behind
      the door.
    </p>
   <p>
      The person coming was Mary Jane. She went to the coffin, very soft,
      and kneeled down and looked in; then she put up her handkerchief, and I
      see she begun to cry, though I couldn't hear her, and her back was to me.
      I slid out, and as I passed the dining-room I thought I'd make sure
     <distinct type="l_huck"><choice><orig>them</orig><reg>those</reg></choice></distinct> watchers hadn't seen me; so I looked through the crack, and
      everything was all right. They hadn't stirred.
    </p>
   <p>
      I slipped up to bed, feeling ruther blue, on accounts of the thing playing
      out that way after I had took so much trouble and run so much resk about
      it. Says I, if it could stay where it is, all right; because when we
      get down the river a hundred mile or two I could write back to Mary Jane,
      and she could dig him up again and get it; but that ain't the thing that's
      going to happen; the thing that's going to happen is, the money 'll be
      found when they come to screw on the lid. Then the king 'll get it
      again, and it 'll be a long day before he gives anybody another chance to
      smouch it from him. Of course I <hi rend="italics">wanted</hi> to slide down and get it out of
      there, but I dasn't try it. Every minute it was getting earlier now,
      and pretty soon some of <distinct type="l_huck"><choice><orig>them</orig><reg>those</reg></choice></distinct> watchers would begin to stir, and I might get
      catched—catched with six thousand dollars in my hands that nobody
      hadn't hired me to take care of. I don't wish to be mixed up in no
      such business as that, I says to myself.
    </p>
   <p>
      When I got down stairs in the morning the parlor was shut up, and the
      watchers was gone. There warn't nobody around but the family and the
      widow Bartley and our tribe. I watched their faces to see if
      anything had been happening, but I couldn't tell.
    </p>
   <p>
      Towards the middle of the day the undertaker come with his man, and they
      set the coffin in the middle of the room on a couple of chairs, and then
      set all our chairs in rows, and borrowed more from the neighbors till the
      hall and the parlor and the dining-room was full. I see the coffin
      lid was the way it was before, but I dasn't go to look in under it, with
      folks around.
    </p>
   <p>
      Then the people begun to flock in, and the beats and the girls took seats
      in the front row at the head of the coffin, and for a half an hour the
      people filed around slow, in single rank, and looked down at the dead
      man's face a minute, and some dropped in a tear, and it was all very still
      and solemn, only the girls and the beats holding handkerchiefs to their
      eyes and keeping their heads bent, and sobbing a little. There
      warn't no other sound but the scraping of the feet on the floor and
      blowing noses—because people always blows them more at a funeral
      than they do at other places except church.
    </p>
   <p>
      When the place was packed full the undertaker he slid around in his black
      gloves with his softy soothering ways, putting on the last touches, and
      getting people and things all ship-shape and comfortable, and making no
      more sound than a cat. He never spoke; he moved people around, he
      squeezed in late ones, he opened up passageways, and done it with nods,
      and signs with his hands. Then he took his place over against the
      wall. He was the softest, glidingest, stealthiest man I ever see; and
      there warn't no more smile to him than there is to a ham.

      They had borrowed a melodeum—a sick one; and when everything was
      ready a young woman set down and worked it, and it was pretty skreeky and
      colicky, and everybody joined in and sung, and Peter was the only one that
      had a good thing, according to my notion. Then the Reverend Hobson
      opened up, slow and solemn, and begun to talk; and straight off the most
      outrageous row busted out in the cellar <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>a body</orig><reg>somebody</reg></choice></distinct> ever heard; it was only one
      dog, but he made a most powerful racket, and he kept it up right along;
      the parson he had to stand there, over the coffin, and wait—you
      couldn't hear yourself think. It was right down awkward, and nobody
      didn't seem to know what to do. But pretty soon they see that
      long-legged undertaker make a sign to the preacher as much as to say,
      "Don't you worry—just depend on me." Then he stooped down and
      begun to glide along the wall, just his shoulders showing over the
      people's heads. So he glided along, and the powwow and racket
      getting more and more outrageous all the time; and at last, when he had
      gone around two sides of the room, he disappears down cellar. Then
      in about two seconds we heard a whack, and the dog he finished up with a
      most amazing howl or two, and then everything was dead still, and the
      parson begun his solemn talk where he left off. In a minute or two
      here comes this undertaker's back and shoulders gliding along the wall
      again; and so he glided and glided around three sides of the room, and
      then rose up, and shaded his mouth with his hands, and stretched his neck
      out towards the preacher, over the people's heads, and says, in a kind of
      a coarse whisper, "<hi rend="italics">He had a rat</hi>!" Then he drooped down and glided
      along the wall again to his place. You could see it was a great
      satisfaction to the people, because naturally they wanted to know. A
      little thing like that don't cost nothing, and it's just the little things
      that makes a man to be looked up to and liked. There warn't no more
      popular man in town than what that undertaker was.

      Well, the funeral sermon was very good, but pison long and tiresome; and
      then the king he shoved in and got off some of his usual rubbage, and at
      last the job was through, and the undertaker begun to sneak up on the
      coffin with his screw-driver. I was in a sweat then, and watched him
      pretty keen. But he never meddled at all; just slid the lid along as soft
      as mush, and screwed it down tight and fast. So there I was! I
      didn't know whether the money was in there or not. So, says I,
      s'pose somebody has hogged that bag on the sly?—now how do I know
      whether to write to Mary Jane or not? S'pose she dug him up and didn't
      find nothing, what would she think of me? Blame it, I says, I might get
      hunted up and jailed; I'd better lay low and keep dark, and not write at
      all; the thing's awful mixed now; trying to better it, I've worsened it a
      hundred times, and I wish to goodness I'd just let it alone, dad fetch the
      whole business!
    </p>
   <p>
      They buried him, and we come back home, and I went to watching faces again—I
      couldn't help it, and I couldn't rest easy. But nothing come of it;
      the faces didn't tell me nothing.
    </p>
   <p>
      The king he visited around in the evening, and sweetened everybody up, and
      made himself ever so friendly; and he give out the idea that his
      congregation over in England would be in a sweat about him, so he must
      hurry and settle up the estate right away and leave for home. He was
      very sorry he was so pushed, and so was everybody; they wished he could
      stay longer, but they said they could see it couldn't be done. And
      he said of course him and William would take the girls home with them; and
      that pleased everybody too, because then the girls would be well fixed and
      amongst their own relations; and it pleased the girls, too—tickled
      them so they clean forgot they ever had a trouble in the world; and told
      him to sell out as quick as he wanted to, they would be ready. <distinct type="l_huck"><choice><orig>Them</orig><reg>Those</reg></choice></distinct>
      poor things was that glad and happy it made my heart ache to see them
      getting fooled and lied to so, but I didn't see no safe way for me to chip
      in and change the general tune.
    </p>
   <p>
      Well, blamed if the king didn't bill the house and the niggers and all the
      property for auction straight off—sale two days after the funeral;
      but anybody could buy private beforehand if they wanted to.
    </p>
   <p>
      So the next day after the funeral, along about noon-time, the girls' joy
      got the first jolt. A couple of nigger traders come along, and the
      king sold them the niggers reasonable, for three-day drafts as they called
      it, and away they went, the two sons up the river to Memphis, and their
      mother down the river to Orleans. I thought <distinct type="l_huck"><choice><orig>them</orig><reg>those</reg></choice></distinct> poor girls and <distinct type="l_huck"><choice><orig>them</orig><reg>those</reg></choice></distinct>
      niggers would break their hearts for grief; they cried around each other,
      and took on so it most made me down sick to see it. The girls said
      they hadn't ever dreamed of seeing the family separated or sold away from
      the town. I can't ever get it out of my memory, the sight of <distinct type="l_huck"><choice><orig>them</orig><reg>those</reg></choice></distinct>
      poor miserable girls and niggers hanging around each other's necks and
      crying; and I <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckon</orig><reg>think</reg></choice></distinct> I couldn't a stood it all, but would a had to bust
      out and tell on our gang if I hadn't knowed the sale warn't no account and
      the niggers would be back home in a week or two.
    </p>
   <p>
      The thing made a big stir in the town, too, and a good many come out
      flatfooted and said it was scandalous to separate the mother and the
      children that way. It injured the frauds some; but the old fool he
      bulled right along, spite of all <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_the_duke">the duke</rs> could say or do, and I tell you
      <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_the_duke">the duke</rs> was powerful uneasy.
    </p>
   <p>
      Next day was auction day. About broad day in the morning the king
      and <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_the_duke">the duke</rs> come up in the garret and woke me up, and I see by their look
      that there was trouble. The king says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Was you in my room night before last?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "No, your majesty"—which was the way I always called him when nobody
      but our gang warn't around.

   <p>
      "Was you in there yisterday er last night?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "No, your majesty."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Honor bright, now—no lies."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Honor bright, your majesty, I'm telling you the truth. I hain't
      been a-near your room since Miss Mary Jane took you and <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_the_duke">the duke</rs> and
      showed it to you."
    </p>
   <p>
      <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_the_duke">The duke</rs> says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Have you seen anybody else go in there?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "No, your grace, not as I remember, I believe."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Stop and think."
    </p>
   <p>
      I studied awhile and see my chance; then I says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Well, I see the niggers go in there several times."
    </p>
   <p>
      Both of them gave a little jump, and looked like they hadn't ever expected
      it, and then like they <hi rend="italics">had</hi>. Then <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_the_duke">the duke</rs> says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "What, all of them?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "No—leastways, not all at once—that is, I don't think I ever
      see them all come <hi rend="italics">out</hi> at once but just one time."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Hello! When was that?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "It was the day we had the funeral. In the morning. It warn't
      early, because I overslept. I was just starting down the ladder, and
      I see them."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Well, go on, <hi rend="italics">go</hi> on! What did they do? How'd they act?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "They didn't do nothing. And they didn't act anyway much, as fur as
      I see. They tiptoed away; so I seen, easy enough, that they'd shoved in
      there to do up your majesty's room, or something, s'posing you was up; and
      found you <hi rend="italics">warn't</hi> up, and so they was hoping to slide out of the way of
      trouble without waking you up, if they hadn't already waked you up."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Great guns, <hi rend="italics">this</hi> is a go!" says the king; and both of them looked pretty
      sick and tolerable silly. They stood there a-thinking and scratching
      their heads a minute, and <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_the_duke">the duke</rs> he bust into a kind of a little raspy
      chuckle, and says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "It does beat all how neat the niggers played their hand. They let
      on to be <hi rend="italics">sorry</hi> they was going out of this region! And I believed
      they <hi rend="italics">was</hi> sorry, and so did you, and so did everybody. Don't ever
      tell <hi rend="italics">me</hi> any more that a nigger ain't got any histrionic talent. Why,
      the way they played that thing it would fool <hi rend="italics">anybody</hi>. In my opinion,
      there's a fortune in 'em. If I had capital and a theater, I wouldn't
      want a better lay-out than that—and here we've gone and sold 'em for
      a song. Yes, and ain't privileged to sing the song yet. Say,
      where <hi rend="italics">is</hi> that song—that draft?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "In the bank for to be collected. Where <hi rend="italics">would</hi> it be?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "Well, <hi rend="italics">that's</hi> all right then, thank goodness."
    </p>
   <p>
      Says I, kind of timid-like:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Is something gone wrong?"
    </p>
   <p>
      The king whirls on me and rips out:
    </p>
   <p>
      "None o' your business! You keep your head shet, and mind y'r own
      affairs—if you got any. Long as you're in this town don't you
      forgit <hi rend="italics">that</hi>—you hear?" Then he says to the duke, "We got to
      jest swaller it and say noth'n': mum's the word for <hi rend="italics">us</hi>."
    </p>
   <p>
      As they was starting down the ladder <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_the_duke">the duke</rs> he chuckles again, and says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Quick sales <hi rend="italics">and</hi> small profits! It's a good business—yes."
    </p>
   <p>

   <p>
      The king snarls around on him and says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "I was trying to do for the best in sellin' 'em out so quick. If the
      profits has turned out to be none, lackin' considable, and none to carry,
      is it my fault any more'n it's yourn?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "Well, <hi rend="italics">they'd</hi> be in this house yet and we <hi rend="italics">wouldn't</hi> if I could a got my
      advice listened to."
    </p>
   <p>
      The king sassed back as much as was safe for him, and then swapped around
      and lit into <hi rend="italics">me</hi> again. He give me down the banks for not coming and
      <hi rend="italics">telling</hi> him I see the niggers come out of his room acting that way—said
      any fool would a <hi rend="italics">knowed</hi> something was up. And then waltzed in and
      cussed <hi rend="italics">himself</hi> awhile, and said it all come of him not laying late and
      taking his natural rest that morning, and he'd be blamed if he'd ever do
      it again. So they went off a-jawing; and I felt dreadful glad I'd
      worked it all off on to the niggers, and yet hadn't done the niggers no
      harm by it.

      BY and by it was getting-up time. So I come down the ladder and
      started for down-stairs; but as I come to the girls' room the door was
      open, and I see Mary Jane setting by her old hair trunk, which was open
      and she'd been packing things in it—getting ready to go to England.
      But she had stopped now with a folded gown in her lap, and had her
      face in her hands, crying. I felt awful bad to see it; of course
      anybody would. I went in there and says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Miss Mary Jane, you can't a-bear to see people in trouble, and I can't—most
      always. Tell me about it."
    </p>
   <p>
      So she done it. And it was the niggers—I just expected it.
      She said the beautiful trip to England was most about spoiled for
      her; she didn't know <hi rend="italics">how</hi> she was ever going to be happy there, knowing the
      mother and the children warn't ever going to see each other no more—and
      then busted out bitterer than ever, and flung up her hands, and says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Oh, dear, dear, to think they ain't <hi rend="italics">ever</hi> going to see each other any
      more!"
    </p>
   <p>
      "But they <hi rend="italics">will</hi>—and inside of two weeks—and I <hi rend="italics">know</hi> it!" says I.
    </p>
   <p>
      Laws, it was out before I could think! And before I could budge she
      throws her arms around my neck and told me to say it <hi rend="italics">again</hi>, say it <hi rend="italics">again</hi>,
      say it <hi rend="italics">again</hi>!
    </p>
   <p>
      I see I had spoke too sudden and said too much, and was in a close place.
      I asked her to let me think a minute; and she set there, very impatient
      and excited and handsome, but looking kind of happy and eased-up, like a
      person that's had a tooth pulled out. So I went to studying it out.
      I says to myself, I <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckon</orig><reg>think</reg></choice></distinct> <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>a body</orig><reg>somebody</reg></choice></distinct> that ups and tells the truth when
      he is in a tight place is taking considerable many resks, though I ain't
      had no experience, and can't say for certain; but it looks so to me,
      anyway; and yet here's a case where I'm blest if it don't look to me like
      the truth is better and actuly <hi rend="italics">safer</hi> than a lie. I must lay it by in
      my mind, and think it over some time or other, it's so kind of strange and
      unregular. I never see nothing like it. Well, I says to myself at
      last, I'm a-going to chance it; I'll up and tell the truth this time,
      though it does seem most like setting down on a kag of powder and touching
      it off just to see where you'll go to. Then I says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Miss Mary Jane, is there any place out of town a little ways where you
      could go and stay three or four days?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "Yes; Mr. Lothrop's. Why?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "Never mind why yet. If I'll tell you how I know the niggers will
      see each other again inside of two weeks—here in this house—and
      <hi rend="italics">prove</hi> how I know it—will you go to Mr. Lothrop's and stay four
      days?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "Four days!" she says; "I'll stay a year!"
    </p>
   <p>
      "All right," I says, "I don't want nothing more out of <hi rend="italics">you</hi> than just your
      word—I druther have it than another man's kiss-the-Bible." She
      smiled and reddened up very sweet, and I says, "If you don't mind it, I'll
      shut the door—and bolt it."
    </p>
   <p>
      Then I come back and set down again, and says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Don't you holler. Just set still and take it like a man. I
      got to tell the truth, and you want to brace up, Miss Mary, because it's a
      bad kind, and going to be hard to take, but there ain't no help for it.
      These uncles of yourn ain't no uncles at all; they're a couple of
      frauds—regular dead-beats. There, now we're over the worst of
      it, you can stand the rest middling easy."
    </p>
   <p>
      It jolted her up like everything, of course; but I was over the shoal
      water now, so I went right along, her eyes a-blazing higher and higher all
      the time, and told her every blame thing, from where we first struck that
      young fool going up to the steamboat, clear through to where she flung
      herself on to the king's breast at the front door and he kissed her
      sixteen or seventeen times—and then up she jumps, with her face
      afire like sunset, and says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "The brute! Come, don't waste a minute—not a <hi rend="italics">second</hi>—we'll
      have them tarred and feathered, and flung in the river!"
    </p>

    </p>
   <p>
      Says I:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Cert'nly. But do you mean <hi rend="italics">before</hi> you go to Mr. Lothrop's, or—"
    </p>
   <p>
      "Oh," she says, "what am I <hi rend="italics">thinking</hi> about!" she says, and set right down
      again. "Don't mind what I said—please don't—you <hi rend="italics">won't,</hi>
      now, <hi rend="italics">will</hi> you?" Laying her silky hand on mine in that kind of a way that I
      said I would die first. "I never thought, I was so stirred up," she
      says; "now go on, and I won't do so any more. You tell me what to
      do, and whatever you say I'll do it."
    </p>
   <p>
     "Well," I says, "it's a rough gang, <distinct type="l_huck"><choice><orig>them</orig><reg>those</reg></choice></distinct> two frauds, and I'm fixed so I
      got to travel with them a while longer, whether I want to or not—I
      druther not tell you why; and if you was to blow on them this town would
      get me out of their claws, and I'd be all right; but there'd be another
      person that you don't know about who'd be in big trouble. Well, we
      got to save <hi rend="italics">him</hi>, hain't we? Of course. Well, then, we won't
      blow on them."
    </p>
   <p>
     Saying <distinct type="l_huck"><choice><orig>them</orig><reg>those</reg></choice></distinct> words put a good idea in my head. I see how maybe I
      could get me and <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> rid of the frauds; get them jailed here, and then
      leave. But I didn't want to run the raft in the daytime without anybody
      aboard to answer questions but me; so I didn't want the plan to begin
      working till pretty late to-night. I says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Miss Mary Jane, I'll tell you what we'll do, and you won't have to stay
      at Mr. Lothrop's so long, nuther. How fur is it?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "A little short of four miles—right out in the country, back here."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Well, that 'll answer. Now you go along out there, and lay low till
      nine or half-past to-night, and then get them to fetch you home again—tell
      them you've thought of something. If you get here before eleven put
      a candle in this window, and if I don't turn up wait <hi rend="italics">till</hi> eleven, and <hi rend="italics">then</hi>
      if I don't turn up it means I'm gone, and out of the way, and safe. Then
      you come out and spread the news around, and get these beats jailed."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Good," she says, "I'll do it."
    </p>
   <p>
      "And if it just happens so that I don't get away, but get took up along
      with them, you must up and say I told you the whole thing beforehand, and
      you must stand by me all you can."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Stand by you! indeed I will. They sha'n't touch a hair of your
      head!" she says, and I see her nostrils spread and her eyes snap when she
      said it, too.
    </p>
   <p>
      "If I get away I sha'n't be here," I says, "to prove these rapscallions
      ain't your uncles, and I couldn't do it if I <hi rend="italics">was</hi> here. I could swear
      they was beats and bummers, that's all, though that's worth something.
      Well, there's others can do that better than what I can, and they're
      people that ain't going to be doubted as quick as I'd be. I'll tell
      you how to find them. Gimme a pencil and a piece of paper. There—'Royal
      Nonesuch, Bricksville.' Put it away, and don't lose it. When
      the court wants to find out something about these two, let them send up to
      Bricksville and say they've got the men that played the Royal Nonesuch,
      and ask for some witnesses—why, you'll have that entire town down
      here before you can hardly wink, Miss Mary. And they'll come
      a-biling, too."
    </p>

   <p>
      I judged we had got everything fixed about right now. So I says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Just let the auction go right along, and don't worry. Nobody don't
      have to pay for the things they buy till a whole day after the auction on
      accounts of the short notice, and they ain't going out of this till they
      get that money; and the way we've fixed it the sale ain't going to count,
      and they ain't going to get no money. It's just like the way it was
      with the niggers—it warn't no sale, and the niggers will be back
      before long. Why, they can't collect the money for the <hi rend="italics">niggers</hi> yet—they're
      in the worst kind of a fix, Miss Mary."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Well," she says, "I'll run down to breakfast now, and then I'll start
      straight for Mr. Lothrop's."
    </p>
   <p>
      "'Deed, <hi rend="italics">that</hi> ain't the ticket, Miss Mary Jane," I says, "by no manner of
      means; go <hi rend="italics">before</hi> breakfast."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Why?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "What did you <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckon</orig><reg>think</reg></choice></distinct> I wanted you to go at all for, Miss Mary?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "Well, I never thought—and come to think, I don't know. What
      was it?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "Why, it's because you ain't one of these leather-face people. I
      don't want no better book than what your face is. <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>A body</orig><reg>Somebody</reg></choice></distinct> can set
      down and read it off like coarse print. Do you <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckon</orig><reg>think</reg></choice></distinct> you can go and
      face your uncles when they come to kiss you good-morning, and never—"
    </p>
   <p>
      "There, there, don't! Yes, I'll go before breakfast—I'll be
      glad to. And leave my sisters with them?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "Yes; never mind about them. They've got to stand it yet a while.
      They might suspicion something if all of you was to go. I
      don't want you to see them, nor your sisters, nor nobody in this town; if
      a neighbor was to ask how is your uncles this morning your face would tell
      something. No, you go right along, Miss Mary Jane, and I'll fix it
      with all of them. I'll tell Miss Susan to give your love to your uncles
      and say you've went away for a few hours for to get a little rest and
      change, or to see a friend, and you'll be back to-night or early in the
      morning."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Gone to see a friend is all right, but I won't have my love given to
      them."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Well, then, it sha'n't be." It was well enough to tell <hi rend="italics">her</hi> so—no
      harm in it. It was only a little thing to do, and no trouble; and
      it's the little things that smooths people's roads the most, down here
      below; it would make Mary Jane comfortable, and it wouldn't cost nothing.
      Then I says: "There's one more thing—that bag of money."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Well, they've got that; and it makes me feel pretty silly to think <hi rend="italics">how</hi>
      they got it."
    </p>
   <p>
      "No, you're out, there. They hain't got it."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Why, who's got it?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "I wish I knowed, but I don't. I <hi rend="italics">had</hi> it, because I stole it from
      them; and I stole it to give to you; and I know where I hid it, but I'm
      afraid it ain't there no more. I'm awful sorry, Miss Mary Jane, I'm
      just as sorry as I can be; but I done the best I could; I did honest.
      I come nigh getting caught, and I had to shove it into the first
      place I come to, and run—and it warn't a good place."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Oh, stop blaming yourself—it's too bad to do it, and I won't allow
      it—you couldn't help it; it wasn't your fault. Where did you
      hide it?"
    </p>
   <p>
      I didn't want to set her to thinking about her troubles again; and I
      couldn't seem to get my mouth to tell her what would make her see that
      corpse laying in the coffin with that bag of money on his stomach. So
      for a minute I didn't say nothing; then I says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "I'd ruther not <hi rend="italics">tell</hi> you where I put it, Miss Mary Jane, if you don't mind
      letting me off; but I'll write it for you on a piece of paper, and you can
      read it along the road to Mr. Lothrop's, if you want to. Do you
      <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckon</orig><reg>think</reg></choice></distinct> that 'll do?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "Oh, yes."
    </p>
   <p>
      So I wrote: "I put it in the coffin. It was in there when you
      was crying there, away in the night. I was behind the door, and I
      was mighty sorry for you, Miss Mary Jane."
    </p>
   <p>
        
    </p>
   <figure>
      <graphic url="media/c28-244.jpg"/>

   <p>
       <lb/>
    </p>
   <p>
      It made my eyes water a little to remember her crying there all by herself
      in the night, and <distinct type="l_huck"><choice><orig>them</orig><reg>those</reg></choice></distinct> devils laying there right under her own roof,
      shaming her and robbing her; and when I folded it up and give it to her I
      see the water come into her eyes, too; and she shook me by the hand, hard,
      and says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "<hi rend="italics">Good</hi>-bye. I'm going to do everything just as you've told me; and if
      I don't ever see you again, I sha'n't ever forget you and I'll think of
      you a many and a many a time, and I'll <hi rend="italics">pray</hi> for you, too!"—and she
      was gone.
    </p>
   <p>
      Pray for me! I <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckoned</orig><reg>thought</reg></choice></distinct> if she knowed me she'd take a job that was
      more nearer her size. But I bet she done it, just the same—she
      was just that kind. She had the grit to pray for Judus if she took
      the notion—there warn't no back-down to her, I judge. You may
      say what you want to, but in my opinion she had more sand in her than any
      girl I ever see; in my opinion she was just full of sand. It sounds
      like flattery, but it ain't no flattery. And when it comes to beauty—and
      goodness, too—she lays over them all. I hain't ever seen her
      since that time that I see her go out of that door; no, I hain't ever seen
      her since, but I <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckon</orig><reg>think</reg></choice></distinct> I've thought of her a many and a many a million
      times, and of her saying she would pray for me; and if ever I'd a thought
      it would do any good for me to pray for <hi rend="italics">her</hi>, blamed if I wouldn't a done
      it or bust.
    </p>
   <p>
      Well, Mary Jane she lit out the back way, I <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckon</orig><reg>think</reg></choice></distinct>; because nobody see her
      go. When I struck Susan and the hare-lip, I says:
    </p>
   <p>
       "What's the name of <distinct type="l_huck"><choice><orig>them</orig><reg>those</reg></choice></distinct> people over on t'other side of the river that you
      all goes to see sometimes?"
    </p>
   <p>
      They says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "There's several; but it's the Proctors, mainly."
    </p>
   <p>
      "That's the name," I says; "I most forgot it. Well, Miss Mary Jane
      she told me to tell you she's gone over there in a dreadful hurry—one
      of them's sick."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Which one?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "I don't know; leastways, I kinder forget; but I thinks it's—"
    </p>
   <p>
      "Sakes alive, I hope it ain't <hi rend="italics">Hanner</hi>?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "I'm sorry to say it," I says, "but Hanner's the very one."
    </p>
   <p>
      "My goodness, and she so well only last week! Is she took bad?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "It ain't no name for it. They set up with her all night, Miss Mary
      Jane said, and they don't think she'll last many hours."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Only think of that, now! What's the matter with her?"
    </p>
   <p>
      I couldn't think of anything reasonable, right off that way, so I says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Mumps."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Mumps your granny! They don't set up with people that's got the
      mumps."
    </p>
   <p>
      "They don't, don't they? You better bet they do with <hi rend="italics">these</hi> mumps.
      These mumps is different. It's a new kind, Miss Mary Jane
      said."
    </p>

   <p>
       <lb/>
    </p>
   <p>
      "How's it a new kind?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "Because it's mixed up with other things."
    </p>
   <p>
      "What other things?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "Well, measles, and whooping-cough, and erysiplas, and consumption, and
      yaller janders, and brain-fever, and I don't know what all."
    </p>
   <p>
      "My land! And they call it the <hi rend="italics">mumps</hi>?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "That's what Miss Mary Jane said."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Well, what in the nation do they call it the <hi rend="italics">mumps</hi> for?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "Why, because it <hi rend="italics">is</hi> the mumps. That's what it starts with."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Well, ther' ain't no sense in it. <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>A body</orig><reg>Somebody</reg></choice></distinct> might stump his toe, and
      take pison, and fall down the well, and break his neck, and bust his
      brains out, and somebody come along and ask what killed him, and some
      numskull up and say, 'Why, he stumped his <hi rend="italics">toe</hi>.' Would ther' be any
      sense in that? <hi rend="italics">No</hi>. And ther' ain't no sense in <hi rend="italics">this</hi>, nuther. Is
      it ketching?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "Is it <hi rend="italics">ketching</hi>? Why, how you talk. Is a <hi rend="italics">harrow</hi> catching—in
      the dark? If you don't hitch on to one tooth, you're bound to on another,
      ain't you? And you can't get away with that tooth without fetching the
      whole harrow along, can you? Well, these kind of mumps is a kind of
      a harrow, as you may say—and it ain't no slouch of a harrow, nuther,
      you come to get it hitched on good."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Well, it's awful, I think," says the hare-lip. "I'll go to Uncle
      Harvey and—"
    </p>
   <p>
      "Oh, yes," I says, "I <hi rend="italics">would</hi>. Of <hi rend="italics">course</hi> I would. I wouldn't
      lose no time."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Well, why wouldn't you?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "Just look at it a minute, and maybe you can see. Hain't your uncles
      obleegd to get along home to England as fast as they can? And do you
      <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckon</orig><reg>think</reg></choice></distinct> they'd be mean enough to go off and leave you to go all that
      journey by yourselves? <hi rend="italics">you</hi> know they'll wait for you. So fur,
      so good. Your uncle Harvey's a preacher, ain't he? Very well, then;
      is a <hi rend="italics">preacher</hi> going to deceive a steamboat clerk? is he going to deceive a
      <hi rend="italics">ship clerk?</hi>—so as to get them to let Miss Mary Jane go aboard?
      Now <hi rend="italics">you</hi> know he ain't. What <hi rend="italics">will</hi> he do, then? Why, he'll
      say, 'It's a great pity, but my church matters has got to get along the
      best way they can; for my niece has been exposed to the dreadful
      pluribus-unum mumps, and so it's my bounden duty to set down here and wait
      the three months it takes to show on her if she's got it.' But never
      mind, if you think it's best to tell your uncle Harvey—"
    </p>
   <p>
      "Shucks, and stay fooling around here when we could all be having good
      times in England whilst we was waiting to find out whether Mary Jane's got
      it or not? Why, you talk like a muggins."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Well, anyway, maybe you'd better tell some of the neighbors."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Listen at that, now. You do beat all for natural stupidness. Can't
      you <hi rend="italics">see</hi> that <hi rend="italics">they'd</hi> go and tell? Ther' ain't no way but just to not
      tell anybody at <hi rend="italics">all</hi>."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Well, maybe you're right—yes, I judge you <hi rend="italics">are</hi> right."
    </p>
   <p>
      "But I <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckon</orig><reg>think</reg></choice></distinct> we ought to tell Uncle Harvey she's gone out a while,
      anyway, so he won't be uneasy about her?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "Yes, Miss Mary Jane she wanted you to do that. She says, 'Tell them
      to give Uncle Harvey and William my love and a kiss, and say I've run over
      the river to see Mr.'—Mr.—what <hi rend="italics">is</hi> the name of that rich family
      your uncle Peter used to think so much of?—I mean the one that—"
    </p>
   <p>
      "Why, you must mean the Apthorps, ain't it?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "Of course; bother <distinct type="l_huck"><choice><orig>them</orig><reg>those</reg></choice></distinct> kind of names, <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>a body</orig><reg>somebody</reg></choice></distinct> can't ever seem to remember
      them, half the time, somehow. Yes, she said, say she has run over
      for to ask the Apthorps to be sure and come to the auction and buy this
      house, because she allowed her uncle Peter would ruther they had it than
      anybody else; and she's going to stick to them till they say they'll come,
      and then, if she ain't too tired, she's coming home; and if she is, she'll
      be home in the morning anyway. She said, don't say nothing about the
      Proctors, but only about the Apthorps—which 'll be perfectly true,
      because she is going there to speak about their buying the house; I know
      it, because she told me so herself."
    </p>
   <p>
      "All right," they said, and cleared out to lay for their uncles, and give
      them the love and the kisses, and tell them the message.
    </p>
   <p>
      Everything was all right now. The girls wouldn't say nothing because
      they wanted to go to England; and the king and <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_the_duke">the duke</rs> would ruther Mary
      Jane was off working for the auction than around in reach of Doctor
      Robinson. I felt very good; I judged I had done it pretty neat—I
      <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckoned</orig><reg>thought</reg></choice></distinct> <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom Sawyer</rs>couldn't a done it no neater himself. Of course
      he would a throwed more style into it, but I can't do that very handy, not
      being brung up to it.
    </p>
   <p>
      Well, they held the auction in the public square, along towards the end of
      the afternoon, and it strung along, and strung along, and the old man he
      was on hand and looking his level pisonest, up there longside of the
      auctioneer, and chipping in a little Scripture now and then, or a little
      goody-goody saying of some kind, and <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_the_duke">the duke</rs> he was around goo-gooing for
      sympathy all he knowed how, and just spreading himself generly.

   <p>
      But by and by the thing dragged through, and everything was sold—everything
      but a little old trifling lot in the graveyard. So they'd got to
      work that off—I never see such a girafft as the king was for wanting
      to swallow <hi rend="italics">everything</hi>. Well, whilst they was at it a steamboat
      landed, and in about two minutes up comes a crowd a-whooping and yelling
      and laughing and carrying on, and singing out:
    </p>
   <p>
      "<hi rend="italics">Here's</hi> your opposition line! here's your two sets o' heirs to old Peter
      Wilks—and you pays your money and you takes your choice!"

      THEY was fetching a very nice-looking old gentleman along, and a
      nice-looking younger one, with his right arm in a sling. And, my
      souls, how the people yelled and laughed, and kept it up. But I
      didn't see no joke about it, and I judged it would strain <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_the_duke">the duke</rs> and the
      king some to see any. I <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckoned</orig><reg>thought</reg></choice></distinct> they'd turn pale. But no,
      nary a pale did <hi rend="italics">they</hi> turn. <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_the_duke">The duke</rs> he never let on he suspicioned what
      was up, but just went a goo-gooing around, happy and satisfied, like a jug
      that's googling out buttermilk; and as for the king, he just gazed and
      gazed down sorrowful on them new-comers like it give him the stomach-ache
      in his very heart to think there could be such frauds and rascals in the
      world. Oh, he done it admirable. Lots of the principal people
      gethered around the king, to let him see they was on his side. That
      old gentleman that had just come looked all puzzled to death. Pretty
      soon he begun to speak, and I see straight off he pronounced <hi rend="italics">like</hi> an
      Englishman—not the king's way, though the king's <hi rend="italics">was</hi> pretty good for
      an imitation. I can't give the old gent's words, nor I can't imitate
      him; but he turned around to the crowd, and says, about like this:
    </p>
   <p>
      "This is a surprise to me which I wasn't looking for; and I'll
      acknowledge, candid and frank, I ain't very well fixed to meet it and
      answer it; for my brother and me has had misfortunes; he's broke his arm,
      and our baggage got put off at a town above here last night in the night
      by a mistake. I am Peter Wilks' brother Harvey, and this is his
      brother William, which can't hear nor speak—and can't even make
      signs to amount to much, now't he's only got one hand to work <distinct type="l_huck"><choice><orig>them</orig><reg>those</reg></choice></distinct> with.
      We are who we say we are; and in a day or two, when I get the
      baggage, I can prove it. But up till then I won't say nothing more, but go
      to the hotel and wait."
    </p>
   <p>
      So him and the new dummy started off; and the king he laughs, and blethers
      out:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Broke his arm—<hi rend="italics">very</hi> likely, <hi rend="italics">ain't</hi> it?—and very convenient,
      too, for a fraud that's got to make signs, and ain't learnt how. Lost
      their baggage! That's <hi rend="italics">mighty</hi> good!—and mighty ingenious—under
      the <hi rend="italics">circumstances</hi>!"
    </p>
   <p>
      So he laughed again; and so did everybody else, except three or four, or
      maybe half a dozen. One of these was that doctor; another one was a
      sharp-looking gentleman, with a carpet-bag of the old-fashioned kind made
      out of carpet-stuff, that had just come off of the steamboat and was
      talking to him in a low voice, and glancing towards the king now and then
      and nodding their heads—it was Levi Bell, the lawyer that was gone
      up to Louisville; and another one was a big rough husky that come along
      and listened to all the old gentleman said, and was listening to the king
      now. And when the king got done this husky up and says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Say, looky here; if you are Harvey Wilks, when'd you come to this town?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "The day before the funeral, friend," says the king.
    </p>
   <p>
      "But what time o' day?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "In the evenin'—'bout an hour er two before sundown."
    </p>
   <p>
      "<hi rend="italics">How'd</hi> you come?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "I come down on the Susan Powell from Cincinnati."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Well, then, how'd you come to be up at the Pint in the <hi rend="italics">mornin</hi>'—in a
      canoe?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "I warn't up at the Pint in the mornin'."
    </p>
   <p>
      "It's a lie."
    </p>
   <p>
      Several of them jumped for him and begged him not to talk that way to an
      old man and a preacher.
    </p>
   <p>
      "Preacher be hanged, he's a fraud and a liar. He was up at the Pint
      that mornin'. I live up there, don't I? Well, I was up there,
      and he was up there. I see him there. He come in a canoe,
      along with Tim Collins and a boy."
    </p>
   <p>
      The doctor he up and says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Would you know the boy again if you was to see him, Hines?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "I <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckon</orig><reg>think</reg></choice></distinct> I would, but I don't know. Why, yonder he is, now. I
      know him perfectly easy."
    </p>
   <p>
      It was me he pointed at. The doctor says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Neighbors, I don't know whether the new couple is frauds or not; but if
      <hi rend="italics">these</hi> two ain't frauds, I am an idiot, that's all. I think it's our
      duty to see that they don't get away from here till we've looked into this
      thing. Come along, Hines; come along, the rest of you. We'll take
      these fellows to the tavern and affront them with t'other couple, and I
      <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckon</orig><reg>think</reg></choice></distinct> we'll find out <hi rend="italics">something</hi> before we get through."
    </p>
   <p>
      It was nuts for the crowd, though maybe not for the king's friends; so we
      all started. It was about sundown. The doctor he led me along
      by the hand, and was plenty kind enough, but he never let go my hand.
    </p>
   <p>
        
    </p>

   <p>
       <lb/>
    </p>
   <p>
      We all got in a big room in the hotel, and lit up some candles, and
      fetched in the new couple. First, the doctor says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "I don't wish to be too hard on these two men, but I think they're frauds,
      and they may have complices that we don't know nothing about. If
      they have, won't the complices get away with that bag of gold Peter Wilks
      left? It ain't unlikely. If these men ain't frauds, they won't
      object to sending for that money and letting us keep it till they prove
      they're all right—ain't that so?"
    </p>
   <p>
      Everybody agreed to that. So I judged they had our gang in a pretty
      tight place right at the outstart. But the king he only looked
      sorrowful, and says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Gentlemen, I wish the money was there, for I ain't got no disposition to
      throw anything in the way of a fair, open, out-and-out investigation o'
      this misable business; but, alas, the money ain't there; you k'n send and
      see, if you want to."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Where is it, then?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "Well, when my niece give it to me to keep for her I took and hid it
      inside o' the straw tick o' my bed, not wishin' to bank it for the few
      days we'd be here, and considerin' the bed a safe place, we not bein' used
      to niggers, and suppos'n' 'em honest, like servants in England. The
      niggers stole it the very next mornin' after I had went down stairs; and
      when I sold 'em I hadn't missed the money yit, so they got clean away with
      it. My servant here k'n tell you 'bout it, gentlemen."
    </p>
   <p>
      The doctor and several said "Shucks!" and I see nobody didn't altogether
      believe him. One man asked me if I see the niggers steal it. I
      said no, but I see them sneaking out of the room and hustling away, and I
      never thought nothing, only I <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckoned</orig><reg>thought</reg></choice></distinct> they was afraid they had waked up
      my master and was trying to get away before he made trouble with them.
      That was all they asked me. Then the doctor whirls on me and
      says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Are <hi rend="italics">you</hi> English, too?"
    </p>
   <p>
      I says yes; and him and some others laughed, and said, "Stuff!"
    </p>
   <p>
      Well, then they sailed in on the general investigation, and there we had
      it, up and down, hour in, hour out, and nobody never said a word about
      supper, nor ever seemed to think about it—and so they kept it up,
      and kept it up; and it <hi rend="italics">was</hi> the worst mixed-up thing you ever see. They
      made the king tell his yarn, and they made the old gentleman tell his'n;
      and anybody but a lot of prejudiced chuckleheads would a <hi rend="italics">seen</hi> that the old
      gentleman was spinning truth and t'other one lies. And by and by
      they had me up to tell what I knowed. The king he give me a
      left-handed look out of the corner of his eye, and so I knowed enough to
      talk on the right side. I begun to tell about Sheffield, and how we
      lived there, and all about the English Wilkses, and so on; but I didn't
      get pretty fur till the doctor begun to laugh; and Levi Bell, the lawyer,
      says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Set down, my boy; I wouldn't strain myself if I was you. I <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckon</orig><reg>think</reg></choice></distinct>
      you ain't used to lying, it don't seem to come handy; what you want is
      practice. You do it pretty awkward."
    </p>
   <p>
      I didn't care nothing for the compliment, but I was glad to be let off,
      anyway.
    </p>
   <p>
      The doctor he started to say something, and turns and says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "If you'd been in town at first, Levi Bell—" The king broke in and
      reached out his hand, and says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Why, is this my poor dead brother's old friend that he's wrote so often
      about?"
    </p>
   <p>
      The lawyer and him shook hands, and the lawyer smiled and looked pleased,
      and they talked right along awhile, and then got to one side and talked
      low; and at last the lawyer speaks up and says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "That 'll fix it. I'll take the order and send it, along with your
      brother's, and then they'll know it's all right."
    </p>
   <p>
      So they got some paper and a pen, and the king he set down and twisted his
      head to one side, and chawed his tongue, and scrawled off something; and
      then they give the pen to the duke—and then for the first time the
      duke looked sick. But he took the pen and wrote. So then the
      lawyer turns to the new old gentleman and says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "You and your brother please write a line or two and sign your names."
    </p>
   <p>
        
    </p>

   <p>
       <lb/>
    </p>
   <p>
      The old gentleman wrote, but nobody couldn't read it. The lawyer
      looked powerful astonished, and says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Well, it beats <hi rend="italics">me</hi>"—and snaked a lot of old letters out of his
      pocket, and examined them, and then examined the old man's writing, and
      then <hi rend="italics">them</hi> again; and then says: "These old letters is from Harvey
      Wilks; and here's <hi rend="italics">these</hi> two handwritings, and anybody can see they didn't
      write them" (the king and <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_the_duke">the duke</rs> looked sold and foolish, I tell you, to
      see how the lawyer had took them in), "and here's <hi rend="italics">this</hi> old gentleman's
      hand writing, and anybody can tell, easy enough, <hi rend="italics">he</hi> didn't write them—fact
      is, the scratches he makes ain't properly <hi rend="italics">writing</hi> at all. Now,
      here's some letters from—"
    </p>
   <p>
      The new old gentleman says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "If you please, let me explain. Nobody can read my hand but my
      brother there—so he copies for me. It's <hi rend="italics">his</hi> hand you've got
      there, not mine."
    </p>
   <p>
      "<hi rend="italics">Well</hi>!" says the lawyer, "this <hi rend="italics">is</hi> a state of things. I've got some
      of William's letters, too; so if you'll get him to write a line or so we
      can com—"
    </p>
   <p>
      "He <hi rend="italics">can't</hi> write with his left hand," says the old gentleman. "If he
      could use his right hand, you would see that he wrote his own letters and
      mine too. Look at both, please—they're by the same hand."
    </p>
   <p>
      The lawyer done it, and says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "I believe it's so—and if it ain't so, there's a heap stronger
      resemblance than I'd noticed before, anyway. Well, well, well!
      I thought we was right on the track of a solution, but it's gone to
      grass, partly. But anyway, one thing is proved—<hi rend="italics">these</hi> two ain't
      either of 'em Wilkses"—and he wagged his head towards the king and
      <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_the_duke">the duke</rs>.
    </p>
   <p>
      Well, what do you think? That muleheaded old fool wouldn't give in
      <hi rend="italics">then</hi>! Indeed he wouldn't. Said it warn't no fair test. Said
      his brother William was the cussedest joker in the world, and hadn't tried
      to write—<hi rend="italics">he</hi> see William was going to play one of his jokes the
      minute he put the pen to paper. And so he warmed up and went
      warbling and warbling right along till he was actuly beginning to believe
      what he was saying <hi rend="italics">himself</hi>; but pretty soon the new gentleman broke in,
      and says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "I've thought of something. Is there anybody here that helped to lay
      out my br—helped to lay out the late Peter Wilks for burying?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "Yes," says somebody, "me and Ab Turner done it. We're both here."
    </p>
   <p>
      Then the old man turns towards the king, and says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Perhaps this gentleman can tell me what was tattooed on his breast?"
    </p>
   <p>
      Blamed if the king didn't have to brace up mighty quick, or he'd a squshed
      down like a bluff bank that the river has cut under, it took him so
      sudden; and, mind you, it was a thing that was calculated to make most
      <hi rend="italics">anybody</hi> sqush to get fetched such a solid one as that without any notice,
      because how was <hi rend="italics">he</hi> going to know what was tattooed on the man? He
      whitened a little; he couldn't help it; and it was mighty still in there,
      and everybody bending a little forwards and gazing at him. Says I to
      myself, <hi rend="italics">now</hi> he'll throw up the sponge—there ain't no more use.
      Well, did he? <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>A body</orig><reg>Somebody</reg></choice></distinct> can't hardly believe it, but he didn't.
      I <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckon</orig><reg>think</reg></choice></distinct> he thought he'd keep the thing up till he tired <distinct type="l_huck"><choice><orig>them</orig><reg>those</reg></choice></distinct> people
      out, so they'd thin out, and him and <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_the_duke">the duke</rs> could break loose and get
      away. Anyway, he set there, and pretty soon he begun to smile, and
      says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Mf! It's a <hi rend="italics">very</hi> tough question, <hi rend="italics">ain't</hi> it! <hi rend="italics">yes</hi>, sir, I k'n
      tell you what's tattooed on his breast. It's jest a small, thin,
      blue arrow—that's what it is; and if you don't look clost, you can't
      see it. <hi rend="italics">now</hi> what do you say—hey?"
    </p>
   <p>
      Well, I never see anything like that old blister for clean out-and-out
      cheek.
    </p>
   <p>
      The new old gentleman turns brisk towards Ab Turner and his pard, and his
      eye lights up like he judged he'd got the king <hi rend="italics">this</hi> time, and says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "There—you've heard what he said! Was there any such mark on
      Peter Wilks' breast?"
    </p>
   <p>
      Both of them spoke up and says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "We didn't see no such mark."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Good!" says the old gentleman. "Now, what you <hi rend="italics">did</hi> see on his breast
      was a small dim P, and a B (which is an initial he dropped when he was
      young), and a W, with dashes between them, so: P—B—W"—and
      he marked them that way on a piece of paper. "Come, ain't that what
      you saw?"
    </p>
   <p>
      Both of them spoke up again, and says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "No, we <hi rend="italics">didn't</hi>. We <distinct type="l_huck"><choice><orig>never seen</orig><reg>have never seen</reg></choice></distinct> any marks at all."
    </p>
   <p>
      Well, everybody <hi rend="italics">was</hi> in a state of mind now, and they sings out:
    </p>
   <p>
      "The whole <hi rend="italics">bilin</hi>' of 'm 's frauds! Le's duck 'em! le's drown 'em!
      le's ride 'em on a rail!" and everybody was whooping at once, and there
      was a rattling powwow. But the lawyer he jumps on the table and
      yells, and says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Gentlemen—gentle<hi rend="italics">men!</hi> Hear me just a word—just a <hi rend="italics">single</hi>
      word—if you <hi rend="italics">please</hi>! There's one way yet—let's go and dig
      up the corpse and look."
    </p>
   <p>
        
    </p>

   <p>
       <lb/>
    </p>
   <p>
      That took them.
    </p>
   <p>
      "Hooray!" they all shouted, and was starting right off; but the lawyer and
      the doctor sung out:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Hold on, hold on! Collar all these four men and the boy, and fetch
      <hi rend="italics">them</hi> along, too!"
    </p>
   <p>
     "We'll do it!" they all shouted; "and if we don't find <distinct type="l_huck"><choice><orig>them</orig><reg>those</reg></choice></distinct> marks we'll
      lynch the whole gang!"
    </p>
   <p>
      I <hi rend="italics">was</hi> scared, now, I tell you. But there warn't no getting away, you
      know. They gripped us all, and marched us right along, straight for the
      graveyard, which was a mile and a half down the river, and the whole town
      at our heels, for we made noise enough, and it was only nine in the
      evening.
    </p>
   <p>
      As we went by our house I wished I hadn't sent Mary Jane out of town;
      because now if I could tip her the wink she'd light out and save me, and
      blow on our dead-beats.
    </p>
   <p>
      Well, we swarmed along down the river road, just carrying on like
      wildcats; and to make it more scary the sky was darking up, and the
      lightning beginning to wink and flitter, and the wind to shiver amongst
      the leaves. This was the most awful trouble and most dangersome I ever was
      in; and I was kinder stunned; everything was going so different from what
      I had allowed for; stead of being fixed so I could take my own time if I
      wanted to, and see all the fun, and have Mary Jane at my back to save me
      and set me free when the close-fit come, here was nothing in the world
      betwixt me and sudden death but just <distinct type="l_huck"><choice><orig>them</orig><reg>those</reg></choice></distinct> tattoo-marks. If they
      didn't find them—
    </p>
   <p>
      I couldn't bear to think about it; and yet, somehow, I couldn't think
      about nothing else. It got darker and darker, and it was a beautiful
      time to give the crowd the slip; but that big husky had me by the wrist—Hines—and
      <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>a body</orig><reg>somebody</reg></choice></distinct> might as well try to give Goliar the slip. He dragged me
      right along, he was so excited, and I had to run to keep up.
    </p>
   <p>
      When they got there they swarmed into the graveyard and washed over it
      like an overflow. And when they got to the grave they found they had
      about a hundred times as many shovels as they wanted, but nobody hadn't
      thought to fetch a lantern. But they sailed into digging anyway by
      the flicker of the lightning, and sent a man to the nearest house, a half
      a mile off, to borrow one.
    </p>
   <p>
      So they dug and dug like everything; and it got awful dark, and the rain
      started, and the wind swished and swushed along, and the lightning come
      brisker and brisker, and the thunder boomed; but <distinct type="l_huck"><choice><orig>them</orig><reg>those</reg></choice></distinct> people never took no
      notice of it, they was so full of this business; and one minute you could
      see everything and every face in that big crowd, and the shovelfuls of
      dirt sailing up out of the grave, and the next second the dark wiped it
      all out, and you couldn't see nothing at all.
    </p>
   <p>
      At last they got out the coffin and begun to unscrew the lid, and then
      such another crowding and shouldering and shoving as there was, to scrouge
      in and get a sight, you never see; and in the dark, that way, it was
      awful. Hines he hurt my wrist dreadful pulling and tugging so, and I
      <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckon</orig><reg>think</reg></choice></distinct> he clean forgot I was in the world, he was so excited and panting.
    </p>
   <p>
      All of a sudden the lightning let go a perfect sluice of white glare, and
      somebody sings out:
    </p>
   <p>
      "By the living jingo, here's the bag of gold on his breast!"
    </p>
   <p>
      Hines let out a whoop, like everybody else, and dropped my wrist and give
      a big surge to bust his way in and get a look, and the way I lit out and
      shinned for the road in the dark there ain't nobody can tell.
    </p>
   <p>
      I had the road all to myself, and I fairly flew—leastways, I had it
      all to myself except the solid dark, and the now-and-then glares, and the
      buzzing of the rain, and the thrashing of the wind, and the splitting of
      the thunder; and sure as you are born I did clip it along!
    </p>
   <p>
      When I struck the town I see there warn't nobody out in the storm, so I
      never hunted for no back streets, but humped it straight through the main
      one; and when I begun to get towards our house I aimed my eye and set it.
      No light there; the house all dark—which made me feel sorry and
      disappointed, I didn't know why. But at last, just as I was sailing
      by, <hi rend="italics">flash</hi> comes the light in Mary Jane's window! and my heart swelled up
      sudden, like to bust; and the same second the house and all was behind me
      in the dark, and wasn't ever going to be before me no more in this world.
      She <hi rend="italics">was</hi> the best girl I ever see, and had the most sand.
    </p>
   <p>
      The minute I was far enough above the town to see I could make the
      towhead, I begun to look sharp for a boat to borrow, and the first time
      the lightning showed me one that wasn't chained I snatched it and shoved.
      It was a canoe, and warn't fastened with nothing but a rope. The
      towhead was a rattling big distance off, away out there in the middle of
      the river, but I didn't lose no time; and when I struck the raft at last I
      was so fagged I would a just laid down to blow and gasp if I could
      afforded it. But I didn't. As I sprung aboard I sung out:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Out with you, Jim, and set her loose! Glory be to goodness, we're
      shut of them!"
    </p>
   <p>
        
    </p>

      <graphic url="media/c29-260.jpg"/>

   <p>
       <lb/>
    </p>
   <p>
      <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> lit out, and was a-coming for me with both arms spread, he was so full
      of joy; but when I glimpsed him in the lightning my heart shot up in my
      mouth and I went overboard backwards; for I forgot he was old King Lear
      and a drownded A-rab all in one, and it most scared the livers and lights
      out of me. But <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> fished me out, and was going to hug me and bless
      me, and so on, he was so glad I was back and we was shut of the king and
      the duke, but I says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Not now; have it for breakfast, have it for breakfast! Cut loose
      and let her slide!"
    </p>
   <p>
      So in two seconds away we went a-sliding down the river, and it <hi rend="italics">did</hi> seem
      so good to be free again and all by ourselves on the big river, and nobody
      to bother us. I had to skip around a bit, and jump up and crack my
      heels a few times—I couldn't help it; but about the third crack I
      noticed a sound that I knowed mighty well, and held my breath and listened
      and waited; and sure enough, when the next flash busted out over the
      water, here they come!—and just a-laying to their oars and making
      their skiff hum! It was the king and <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_the_duke">the duke</rs>.
    </p>
   <p>
      So I wilted right down on to the planks then, and give up; and it was all
      I could do to keep from crying.

   <p>
      WHEN they got aboard the king went for me, and shook me by the collar, and
      says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Tryin' to give us the slip, was ye, you pup! Tired of our company,
      hey?"
    </p>
   <p>
      I says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "No, your majesty, we warn't—<hi rend="italics">please</hi> don't, your majesty!"
    </p>
   <p>
      "Quick, then, and tell us what <hi rend="italics">was</hi> your idea, or I'll shake the insides
      out o' you!"
    </p>
   <p>
      "Honest, I'll tell you everything just as it happened, your majesty.
      The man that had a-holt of me was very good to me, and kept saying
      he had a boy about as big as me that died last year, and he was sorry to
      see a boy in such a dangerous fix; and when they was all took by surprise
      by finding the gold, and made a rush for the coffin, he lets go of me and
      whispers, 'Heel it now, or they'll hang ye, sure!' and I lit out. It
      didn't seem no good for <hi rend="italics">me</hi> to stay—I couldn't do nothing, and I
      didn't want to be hung if I could get away. So I never stopped
      running till I found the canoe; and when I got here I told <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> to hurry,
      or they'd catch me and hang me yet, and said I was afeard you and the duke
      wasn't alive now, and I was awful sorry, and so was Jim, and was awful
      glad when we see you coming; you may ask <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> if I didn't."
    </p>
   <p>
      <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> said it was so; and the king told him to shut up, and said, "Oh, yes,
      it's <hi rend="italics">mighty</hi> likely!" and shook me up again, and said he <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckoned</orig><reg>thought</reg></choice></distinct> he'd
      drownd me. But <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_the_duke">the duke</rs> says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Leggo the boy, you old idiot! Would <hi rend="italics">you</hi> a done any different?
      Did you inquire around for <hi rend="italics">him</hi> when you got loose? I don't
      remember it."
    </p>
   <p>
      So the king let go of me, and begun to cuss that town and everybody in it.
      But <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_the_duke">the duke</rs> says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "You better a blame' sight give <hi rend="italics">yourself</hi> a good cussing, for you're the
      one that's entitled to it most. You hain't done a thing from the
      start that had any sense in it, except coming out so cool and cheeky with
      that imaginary blue-arrow mark. That <hi rend="italics">was</hi> bright—it was right
      down bully; and it was the thing that saved us. For if it hadn't
      been for that they'd a jailed us till them Englishmen's baggage come—and
      then—the penitentiary, you bet! But that trick took 'em to the
      graveyard, and the gold done us a still bigger kindness; for if the
      excited fools hadn't let go all holts and made that rush to get a look
      we'd a slept in our cravats to-night—cravats warranted to <hi rend="italics">wear</hi>, too—longer
      than <hi rend="italics">we'd</hi> need 'em."
    </p>
   <p>
      They was still a minute—thinking; then the king says, kind of
      absent-minded like:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Mf! And we <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckoned</orig><reg>thought</reg></choice></distinct> the <hi rend="italics">niggers</hi> stole it!"
    </p>
   <p>
      That made me squirm!
    </p>
   <p>
      "Yes," says the duke, kinder slow and deliberate and sarcastic, "<hi rend="italics">we</hi> did."
    </p>
   <p>
      After about a half a minute the king drawls out:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Leastways, I did."
    </p>
   <p>
      <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_the_duke">The duke</rs> says, the same way:
    </p>
   <p>
      "On the contrary, I did."
    </p>
   <p>
      The king kind of ruffles up, and says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Looky here, Bilgewater, what'r you referrin' to?"
    </p>
   <p>
      <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_the_duke">The duke</rs> says, pretty brisk:
    </p>
   <p>
      "When it comes to that, maybe you'll let me ask, what was <hi rend="italics">you</hi> referring
      to?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "Shucks!" says the king, very sarcastic; "but I don't know—maybe you
      was asleep, and didn't know what you was about."
    </p>
   <p>
      <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_the_duke">The duke</rs> bristles up now, and says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Oh, let <hi rend="italics">up</hi> on this cussed nonsense; do you take me for a blame' fool?
      Don't you <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckon</orig><reg>think</reg></choice></distinct> I know who hid that money in that coffin?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "<hi rend="italics">Yes</hi>, sir! I know you <hi rend="italics">do</hi> know, because you done it yourself!"
    </p>
   <p>
      "It's a lie!"—and <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_the_duke">the duke</rs> went for him. The king sings out:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Take y'r hands off!—leggo my throat!—I take it all back!"
    </p>
   <p>

   <p>
       <lb/>
    </p>
   <p>
      <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_the_duke">The duke</rs> says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Well, you just own up, first, that you <hi rend="italics">did</hi> hide that money there,
      intending to give me the slip one of these days, and come back and dig it
      up, and have it all to yourself."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Wait jest a minute, duke—answer me this one question, honest and
      fair; if you didn't put the money there, say it, and I'll b'lieve you, and
      take back everything I said."
    </p>
   <p>
      "You old scoundrel, I didn't, and you know I didn't. There, now!"
    </p>
   <p>
      "Well, then, I b'lieve you. But answer me only jest this one more—now
      <hi rend="italics">don't</hi> git mad; didn't you have it in your mind to hook the money and hide
      it?"
    </p>
   <p>
      <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_the_duke">The duke</rs> never said nothing for a little bit; then he says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Well, I don't care if I <hi rend="italics">did</hi>, I didn't <hi rend="italics">do</hi> it, anyway. But you not
      only had it in mind to do it, but you <hi rend="italics">done</hi> it."
    </p>
   <p>
      "I wisht I never die if I done it, duke, and that's honest. I won't
      say I warn't goin' to do it, because I <hi rend="italics">was</hi>; but you—I mean somebody—got
      in ahead o' me."
    </p>
   <p>
      "It's a lie! You done it, and you got to <hi rend="italics">say</hi> you done it, or—"
    </p>
   <p>
      The king began to gurgle, and then he gasps out:
    </p>
   <p>
      "'Nough!—I <hi rend="italics">own up!</hi>"
    </p>
   <p>
      I was very glad to hear him say that; it made me feel much more easier
      than what I was feeling before. So <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_the_duke">the duke</rs> took his hands off and
      says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "If you ever deny it again I'll drown you. It's <hi rend="italics">well</hi> for you to set
      there and blubber like a baby—it's fitten for you, after the way
      you've acted. I never see such an old ostrich for wanting to gobble
      everything—and I a-trusting you all the time, like you was my own
      father. You ought to been ashamed of yourself to stand by and hear
      it saddled on to a lot of poor niggers, and you never say a word for 'em.
      It makes me feel ridiculous to think I was soft enough to <hi rend="italics">believe</hi>
      that rubbage. Cuss you, I can see now why you was so anxious to make
      up the deffisit—you wanted to get what money I'd got out of the
      Nonesuch and one thing or another, and scoop it <hi rend="italics">all</hi>!"
    </p>
   <p>
      The king says, timid, and still a-snuffling:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Why, duke, it was you that said make up the deffisit; it warn't me."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Dry up! I don't want to hear no more out of you!" says <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_the_duke">the duke</rs>.
      "And <hi rend="italics">now</hi> you see what you GOT by it. They've got all their own
      money back, and all of <hi rend="italics">ourn</hi> but a shekel or two <hi rend="italics">besides</hi>. G'long to
      bed, and don't you deffersit <hi rend="italics">me</hi> no more deffersits, long 's <hi rend="italics">you</hi> live!"
    </p>
   <p>
      So the king sneaked into the wigwam and took to his bottle for comfort,
      and before long <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_the_duke">the duke</rs> tackled HIS bottle; and so in about a half an
      hour they was as thick as thieves again, and the tighter they got the
      lovinger they got, and went off a-snoring in each other's arms. They
      both got powerful mellow, but I noticed the king didn't get mellow enough
      to forget to remember to not deny about hiding the money-bag again. That
      made me feel easy and satisfied. Of course when they got to snoring
      we had a long gabble, and I told <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> everything.

   <p>
      WE dasn't stop again at any town for days and days; kept right along down
      the river. We was down south in the warm weather now, and a mighty
      long ways from home. We begun to come to trees with Spanish moss on
      them, hanging down from the limbs like long, gray beards. It was the
      first I ever see it growing, and it made the woods look solemn and dismal.
      So now the frauds <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckoned</orig><reg>thought</reg></choice></distinct> they was out of danger, and they begun to
      work the villages again.
    </p>
   <p>
      First they done a lecture on temperance; but they didn't make enough for
      them both to get drunk on. Then in another village they started a
      dancing-school; but they didn't know no more how to dance than a kangaroo
      does; so the first prance they made the general public jumped in and
      pranced them out of town. Another time they tried to go at
      yellocution; but they didn't yellocute long till the audience got up and
      give them a solid good cussing, and made them skip out. They tackled
      missionarying, and mesmerizing, and doctoring, and telling fortunes, and a
      little of everything; but they couldn't seem to have no luck. So at
      last they got just about dead broke, and laid around the raft as she
      floated along, thinking and thinking, and never saying nothing, by the
      half a day at a time, and dreadful blue and desperate.
    </p>
   <p>
      And at last they took a change and begun to lay their heads together in
      the wigwam and talk low and confidential two or three hours at a time. Jim
      and me got uneasy. We didn't like the look of it. We judged
      they was studying up some kind of worse deviltry than ever. We
      turned it over and over, and at last we made up our minds they was going
      to break into somebody's house or store, or was going into the
      counterfeit-money business, or something. So then we was pretty scared,
      and made up an agreement that we wouldn't have nothing in the world to do
      with such actions, and if we ever got the least show we would give them
      the cold shake and clear out and leave them behind. Well, early one
      morning we hid the raft in a good, safe place about two mile below a
      little bit of a shabby village named Pikesville, and the king he went
      ashore and told us all to stay hid whilst he went up to town and smelt
      around to see if anybody had got any wind of the Royal Nonesuch there yet.
      ("House to rob, you <hi rend="italics">mean</hi>," says I to myself; "and when you get through
      robbing it you'll come back here and wonder what has become of me and Jim
      and the raft—and you'll have to take it out in wondering.") And he
      said if he warn't back by midday <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_the_duke">the duke</rs> and me would know it was all
      right, and we was to come along.
    </p>
   <p>
      So we stayed where we was. <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_the_duke">The duke</rs> he fretted and sweated around,
      and was in a mighty sour way. He scolded us for everything, and we
      couldn't seem to do nothing right; he found fault with every little thing.
      Something was a-brewing, sure. I was good and glad when midday come
      and no king; we could have a change, anyway—and maybe a chance for
      <hi rend="italics">the</hi> change on top of it. So me and <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_the_duke">the duke</rs> went up to the village,
      and hunted around there for the king, and by and by we found him in the
      back room of a little low doggery, very tight, and a lot of loafers
      bullyragging him for sport, and he a-cussing and a-threatening with all
      his might, and so tight he couldn't walk, and couldn't do nothing to them.
      <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_the_duke">The duke</rs> he begun to abuse him for an old fool, and the king begun
      to sass back, and the minute they was fairly at it I lit out and shook the
      reefs out of my hind legs, and spun down the river road like a deer, for I
      see our chance; and I made up my mind that it would be a long day before
      they ever see me and <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> again. I got down there all out of breath
      but loaded up with joy, and sung out:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Set her loose, Jim! we're all right now!"
    </p>
   <p>
      But there warn't no answer, and nobody come out of the wigwam. Jim
      was gone! I set up a shout—and then another—and then
      another one; and run this way and that in the woods, whooping and
      screeching; but it warn't no use—old <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> was gone. Then I set
      down and cried; I couldn't help it. But I couldn't set still long. Pretty
      soon I went out on the road, trying to think what I better do, and I run
      across a boy walking, and asked him if he'd seen a strange nigger dressed
      so and so, and he says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Whereabouts?" says I.
    </p>
   <p>
      "Down to Silas Phelps' place, two mile below here. He's a runaway
      nigger, and they've got him. Was you looking for him?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "You bet I ain't! I run across him in the woods about an hour or two
      ago, and he said if I hollered he'd cut my livers out—and told me to
      lay down and stay where I was; and I done it. Been there ever since;
      afeard to come out."

      "Well," he says, "you needn't be afeard no more, <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>becuz</orig><reg>because</reg></choice></distinct> they've got him. He

      like picking up money out'n the road."
    </p>

      "It was an old fellow—a stranger—and he sold out his chance in
      him for forty dollars, <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>becuz</orig><reg>because</reg></choice></distinct> he's got to go up the river and can't wait.
      Think o' that, now! You bet <hi rend="italics">I'd</hi> wait, if it was seven year."
    </p>
   <p>
      "That's me, every time," says I. "But maybe his chance ain't worth
      no more than that, if he'll sell it so cheap. Maybe there's
      something ain't straight about it."
    </p>
   <p>
      "But it <hi rend="italics">is</hi>, though—straight as a string. I see the handbill
      myself. It tells all about him, to a dot—paints him like a
      picture, and tells the plantation he's frum, below Newr<hi rend="italics">leans</hi>. No-sirree-<hi rend="italics">bob</hi>,
      they ain't no trouble 'bout <hi rend="italics">that</hi> speculation, you bet you. Say,
      gimme a chaw tobacker, won't ye?"
    </p>
   <p>
      I didn't have none, so he left. I went to the raft, and set down in
      the wigwam to think. But I couldn't come to nothing. I thought
      till I wore my head sore, but I couldn't see no way out of the trouble.
      After all this long journey, and after all we'd done for them
      scoundrels, here it was all come to nothing, everything all busted up and
      ruined, because they could have the heart to serve <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> such a trick as
      that, and make him a slave again all his life, and amongst strangers, too,
      for forty dirty dollars.
    </p>
   <p>
      Once I said to myself it would be a thousand times better for <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> to be a
      slave at home where his family was, as long as he'd <hi rend="italics">got</hi> to be a slave, and
      so I'd better write a letter to <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom Sawyer</rs>and tell him to tell <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_miss_watson">Miss Watson</rs> where he was. But I soon give up that notion for two things:
      she'd be mad and disgusted at his rascality and ungratefulness for leaving
      her, and so she'd sell him straight down the river again; and if she
      didn't, everybody naturally despises an ungrateful nigger, and they'd make
      <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> feel it all the time, and so he'd feel ornery and disgraced. And then
      think of <hi rend="italics">me</hi>! It would get all around that Huck Finn helped a nigger
      to get his freedom; and if I was ever to see anybody from that town again
      I'd be ready to get down and lick his boots for shame. That's just
      the way: a person does a low-down thing, and then he don't want to
      take no consequences of it. Thinks as long as he can hide it, it ain't no
      disgrace. That was my fix exactly. The more I studied about this the
      more my conscience went to grinding me, and the more wicked and low-down
      and ornery I got to feeling. And at last, when it hit me all of a sudden
      that here was the plain hand of Providence slapping me in the face and
      letting me know my wickedness was being watched all the time from up there
      in heaven, whilst I was stealing a poor old woman's nigger that hadn't
      ever done me no harm, and now was showing me there's One that's always on
      the lookout, and ain't a-going to allow no such miserable doings to go
      only just so fur and no further, I most dropped in my tracks I was so
      scared. Well, I tried the best I could to kinder soften it up
      somehow for myself by saying I was brung up wicked, and so I warn't so
      much to blame; but something inside of me kept saying, "There was the
      Sunday-school, you could a gone to it; and if you'd a done it they'd a
      learnt you there that people that acts as I'd been acting about that
      nigger goes to everlasting fire."
    </p>
   <p>
      It made me shiver. And I about made up my mind to pray, and see if I
      couldn't try to quit being the kind of a boy I was and be better. So
      I kneeled down. But the words wouldn't come. Why wouldn't
      they? It warn't no use to try and hide it from Him. Nor from
      <hi rend="italics">me</hi>, neither. I knowed very well why they wouldn't come. It was
      because my heart warn't right; it was because I warn't square; it was
      because I was playing double. I was letting <hi rend="italics">on</hi> to give up sin, but
      away inside of me I was holding on to the biggest one of all. I was
      trying to make my mouth <hi rend="italics">say</hi> I would do the right thing and the clean
      thing, and go and write to that nigger's owner and tell where he was; but
      deep down in me I knowed it was a lie, and He knowed it. You can't
      pray a lie—I found that out.
    </p>
   <p>
      So I was full of trouble, full as I could be; and didn't know what to do.
      At last I had an idea; and I says, I'll go and write the letter—and
      then see if I can pray. Why, it was astonishing, the way I felt as
      light as a feather right straight off, and my troubles all gone. So
      I got a piece of paper and a pencil, all glad and excited, and set down
      and wrote:
    </p>
   <p>
      Miss Watson, your runaway nigger <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> is down here two mile below
      Pikesville, and Mr. Phelps has got him and he will give him up for the
      reward if you send.
    </p>
   <p>
      <hi rend="italics">Huck Finn.</hi>
    </p>
   <p>

   <p>
       <lb/>
    </p>
   <p>
      I felt good and all washed clean of sin for the first time I had ever felt
      so in my life, and I knowed I could pray now. But I didn't do it
      straight off, but laid the paper down and set there thinking—thinking
      how good it was all this happened so, and how near I come to being lost
      and going to hell. And went on thinking. And got to thinking
      over our trip down the river; and I see <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> before me all the time: in
      the day and in the night-time, sometimes moonlight, sometimes storms, and
      we a-floating along, talking and singing and laughing. But somehow I
      couldn't seem to strike no places to harden me against him, but only the
      other kind. I'd see him standing my watch on top of his'n, 'stead of
      calling me, so I could go on sleeping; and see him how glad he was when I
      come back out of the fog; and when I come to him again in the swamp, up
      there where the feud was; and such-like times; and would always call me
      honey, and pet me and do everything he could think of for me, and how good
      he always was; and at last I struck the time I saved him by telling the
      men we had small-pox aboard, and he was so grateful, and said I was the
      best friend old <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> ever had in the world, and the <hi rend="italics">only</hi> one he's got now;
      and then I happened to look around and see that paper.
    </p>
   <p>
      It was a close place. I took it up, and held it in my hand. I
      was a-trembling, because I'd got to decide, forever, betwixt two things,
      and I knowed it. I studied a minute, sort of holding my breath, and
      then says to myself:
    </p>
   <p>
      "All right, then, I'll <hi rend="italics">go</hi> to hell"—and tore it up.
    </p>
   <p>
      It was awful thoughts and awful words, but they was said. And I let
      them stay said; and never thought no more about reforming. I shoved
      the whole thing out of my head, and said I would take up wickedness again,
      which was in my line, being brung up to it, and the other warn't. And
      for a starter I would go to work and steal <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> out of slavery again; and
      if I could think up anything worse, I would do that, too; because as long
      as I was in, and in for good, I might as well go the whole hog.
    </p>
   <p>
      Then I set to thinking over how to get at it, and turned over some
      considerable many ways in my mind; and at last fixed up a plan that suited
      me. So then I took the bearings of a woody island that was down the
      river a piece, and as soon as it was fairly dark I crept out with my raft
      and went for it, and hid it there, and then turned in. I slept the
      night through, and got up before it was light, and had my breakfast, and
      put on my store clothes, and tied up some others and one thing or another
      in a bundle, and took the canoe and cleared for shore. I landed
      below where I judged was Phelps's place, and hid my bundle in the woods,
      and then filled up the canoe with water, and loaded rocks into her and
      sunk her where I could find her again when I wanted her, about a quarter
      of a mile below a little steam sawmill that was on the bank.
    </p>
   <p>
      Then I struck up the road, and when I passed the mill I see a sign on it,
      "Phelps's Sawmill," and when I come to the farm-houses, two or three
      hundred yards further along, I kept my eyes peeled, but didn't see nobody
      around, though it was good daylight now. But I didn't mind, because
      I didn't want to see nobody just yet—I only wanted to get the lay of
      the land. According to my plan, I was going to turn up there from the
      village, not from below. So I just took a look, and shoved along,
      straight for town. Well, the very first man I see when I got there was <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_the_duke">the duke</rs>. He was sticking up a bill for the Royal Nonesuch—three-night
      performance—like that other time. They had the cheek, them
      frauds! I was right on him before I could shirk. He looked
      astonished, and says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Hel-<hi rend="italics">lo</hi>! Where'd <hi rend="italics">you</hi> come from?" Then he says, kind of glad
      and eager, "Where's the raft?—got her in a good place?"
    </p>
   <p>
      I says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Why, that's just what I was going to ask your grace."
    </p>
   <p>
      Then he didn't look so joyful, and says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "What was your idea for asking <hi rend="italics">me</hi>?" he says.
    </p>
   <p>
      "Well," I says, "when I see the king in that doggery yesterday I says to
      myself, we can't get him home for hours, till he's soberer; so I went
      a-loafing around town to put in the time and wait. A man up and
      offered me ten cents to help him pull a skiff over the river and back to
      fetch a sheep, and so I went along; but when we was dragging him to the
      boat, and the man left me a-holt of the rope and went behind him to shove
      him along, he was too strong for me and jerked loose and run, and we after
      him. We didn't have no dog, and so we had to chase him all over the
      country till we tired him out. We never got him till dark; then we
      fetched him over, and I started down for the raft. When I got there
      and see it was gone, I says to myself, 'They've got into trouble and had
      to leave; and they've took my nigger, which is the only nigger I've got in
      the world, and now I'm in a strange country, and ain't got no property no
      more, nor nothing, and no way to make my living;' so I set down and cried.
      I slept in the woods all night. But what <hi rend="italics">did</hi> become of the
      raft, then?—and Jim—poor Jim!"
    </p>
   <p>
      "Blamed if I know—that is, what's become of the raft. That old
      fool had made a trade and got forty dollars, and when we found him in the
      doggery the loafers had matched half-dollars with him and got every cent
      but what he'd spent for whisky; and when I got him home late last night
      and found the raft gone, we said, 'That little rascal has stole our raft
      and shook us, and run off down the river.'"
    </p>
   <p>
      "I wouldn't shake my <hi rend="italics">nigger</hi>, would I?—the only nigger I had in the
      world, and the only property."
    </p>
   <p>
      "We never thought of that. Fact is, I <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckon</orig><reg>think</reg></choice></distinct> we'd come to consider
      him <hi rend="italics">our</hi> nigger; yes, we did consider him so—goodness knows we had
      trouble enough for him. So when we see the raft was gone and we flat
      broke, there warn't anything for it but to try the Royal Nonesuch another
      shake. And I've pegged along ever since, dry as a powder-horn. Where's
      that ten cents? Give it here."
    </p>
   <p>
        
    </p>

   <p>
       <lb/>
    </p>
   <p>
      I had considerable money, so I give him ten cents, but begged him to spend
      it for something to eat, and give me some, because it was all the money I
      had, and I hadn't had nothing to eat since yesterday. He never said
      nothing. The next minute he whirls on me and says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Do you <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckon</orig><reg>think</reg></choice></distinct> that nigger would blow on us? We'd skin him if he
      done that!"
    </p>
   <p>
      "How can he blow? Hain't he run off?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "No! That old fool sold him, and never divided with me, and the
      money's gone."
    </p>
   <p>
      "<hi rend="italics">Sold</hi> him?" I says, and begun to cry; "why, he was <hi rend="italics">my</hi> nigger, and
      that was my money. Where is he?—I want my nigger."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Well, you can't <hi rend="italics">get</hi> your nigger, that's all—so dry up your
      blubbering. Looky here—do you think <hi rend="italics">you'd</hi> venture to blow on us?
      Blamed if I think I'd trust you. Why, if you <hi rend="italics">was</hi> to blow on us—"
    </p>
   <p>
      He stopped, but I never see <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_the_duke">the duke</rs> look so ugly out of his eyes before.
      I went on a-whimpering, and says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "I don't want to blow on nobody; and I ain't got no time to blow, nohow. I
      got to turn out and find my nigger."
    </p>
   <p>
      He looked kinder bothered, and stood there with his bills fluttering on
      his arm, thinking, and wrinkling up his forehead. At last he says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "I'll tell you something. We got to be here three days. If
      you'll promise you won't blow, and won't let the nigger blow, I'll tell
      you where to find him."
    </p>
   <p>
      So I promised, and he says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "A farmer by the name of Silas Ph—" and then he stopped. You
      see, he started to tell me the truth; but when he stopped that way, and
      begun to study and think again, I <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckoned</orig><reg>thought</reg></choice></distinct> he was changing his mind.
      And so he was. He wouldn't trust me; he wanted to make sure of
      having me out of the way the whole three days. So pretty soon he
      says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "The man that bought him is named Abram Foster—Abram G. Foster—and
      he lives forty mile back here in the country, on the road to Lafayette."
    </p>
   <p>
      "All right," I says, "I can walk it in three days. And I'll start
      this very afternoon."
    </p>
   <p>
      "No you wont, you'll start <hi rend="italics">now</hi>; and don't you lose any time about it,
      neither, nor do any gabbling by the way. Just keep a tight tongue in
      your head and move right along, and then you won't get into trouble with
      <hi rend="italics">us</hi>, d'ye hear?"
    </p>
   <p>
      That was the order I wanted, and that was the one I played for. I
      wanted to be left free to work my plans.
    </p>
   <p>
      "So clear out," he says; "and you can tell Mr. Foster whatever you want
      to. Maybe you can get him to believe that <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> <hi rend="italics">is</hi> your nigger—some
      idiots don't require documents—leastways I've heard there's such
      down South here. And when you tell him the handbill and the reward's
      bogus, maybe he'll believe you when you explain to him what the idea was
      for getting 'em out. Go 'long now, and tell him anything you want
      to; but mind you don't work your jaw any <hi rend="italics">between</hi> here and there."

   <p>
      So I left, and struck for the back country. I didn't look around,
      but I kinder felt like he was watching me. But I knowed I could tire
      him out at that. I went straight out in the country as much as a
      mile before I stopped; then I doubled back through the woods towards
      Phelps'. I <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckoned</orig><reg>thought</reg></choice></distinct> I better start in on my plan straight off
      without fooling around, because I wanted to stop Jim's mouth till these
      fellows could get away. I didn't want no trouble with their kind.
      I'd seen all I wanted to of them, and wanted to get entirely shut of
      them.

      WHEN I got there it was all still and Sunday-like, and hot and sunshiny;
      the hands was gone to the fields; and there was them kind of faint
      dronings of bugs and flies in the air that makes it seem so lonesome and
      like everybody's dead and gone; and if a breeze fans along and quivers the
      leaves it makes you feel mournful, because you feel like it's spirits
      whispering—spirits that's been dead ever so many years—and you
      always think they're talking about <hi rend="italics">you</hi>. As a general thing it makes
      <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>a body</orig><reg>somebody</reg></choice></distinct> wish <hi rend="italics">he</hi> was dead, too, and done with it all.
    </p>
   <p>
      Phelps' was one of these little one-horse cotton plantations, and they all
      look alike. A rail fence round a two-acre yard; a stile made out of
      logs sawed off and up-ended in steps, like barrels of a different length,
      to climb over the fence with, and for the women to stand on when they are
      going to jump on to a horse; some sickly grass-patches in the big yard,
      but mostly it was bare and smooth, like an old hat with the nap rubbed
      off; big double log-house for the white folks—hewed logs, with the
      chinks stopped up with mud or mortar, and these mud-stripes been
      whitewashed some time or another; round-log kitchen, with a big broad,
      open but roofed passage joining it to the house; log smoke-house back of
      the kitchen; three little log nigger-cabins in a row t'other side the
      smoke-house; one little hut all by itself away down against the back
      fence, and some outbuildings down a piece the other side; ash-hopper and
      big kettle to bile soap in by the little hut; bench by the kitchen door,
      with bucket of water and a gourd; hound asleep there in the sun; more
      hounds asleep round about; about three shade trees away off in a corner;
      some currant bushes and gooseberry bushes in one place by the fence;
      outside of the fence a garden and a watermelon patch; then the cotton
      fields begins, and after the fields the woods.
    </p>
   <p>
      I went around and clumb over the back stile by the ash-hopper, and started
      for the kitchen. When I got a little ways I heard the dim hum of a
      spinning-wheel wailing along up and sinking along down again; and then I
      knowed for certain I wished I was dead—for that <hi rend="italics">is</hi> the lonesomest
      sound in the whole world.
    </p>
   <p>
      I went right along, not fixing up any particular plan, but just trusting
      to Providence to put the right words in my mouth when the time come; for
      I'd noticed that Providence always did put the right words in my mouth if
      I left it alone.
    </p>
   <p>
      When I got half-way, first one hound and then another got up and went for
      me, and of course I stopped and faced them, and kept still. And such
      another powwow as they made! In a quarter of a minute I was a kind
      of a hub of a wheel, as you may say—spokes made out of dogs—circle
      of fifteen of them packed together around me, with their necks and noses
      stretched up towards me, a-barking and howling; and more a-coming; you
      could see them sailing over fences and around corners from everywheres.
    </p>

      A nigger woman come tearing out of the kitchen with a rolling-pin in her
      hand, singing out, "Begone <hi rend="italics">you</hi> Tige! you Spot! begone sah!" and she
      fetched first one and then another of them a clip and sent them howling,
      and then the rest followed; and the next second half of them come back,
      wagging their tails around me, and making friends with me. There
      ain't no harm in a hound, nohow.
    </p>
   <p>
      And behind the woman comes a little nigger girl and two little nigger boys
      without anything on but tow-linen shirts, and they hung on to their
      mother's gown, and peeped out from behind her at me, bashful, the way they
      always do. And here comes the white woman running from the house,
      about forty-five or fifty year old, bareheaded, and her spinning-stick in
      her hand; and behind her comes her little white children, acting the same
      way the little niggers was doing. She was smiling all over so she
      could hardly stand—and says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "It's <hi rend="italics">you</hi>, at last!—<hi rend="italics">ain't</hi> it?"
    </p>
   <p>
      I out with a "Yes'm" before I thought.
    </p>

    </p>
   <p>
      She grabbed me and hugged me tight; and then gripped me by both hands and
      shook and shook; and the tears come in her eyes, and run down over; and
      she couldn't seem to hug and shake enough, and kept saying, "You don't
      look as much like your mother as I <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckoned</orig><reg>thought</reg></choice></distinct> you would; but law sakes, I
      don't care for that, I'm so glad to see you! Dear, dear, it does
      seem like I could eat you up! Children, it's your cousin Tom!—tell
      him howdy."
    </p>
   <p>
      But they ducked their heads, and put their fingers in their mouths, and
      hid behind her. So she run on:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Lize, hurry up and get him a hot breakfast right away—or did you
      get your breakfast on the boat?"
    </p>
   <p>
      I said I had got it on the boat. So then she started for the house,
      leading me by the hand, and the children tagging after. When we got
      there she set me down in a split-bottomed chair, and set herself down on a
      little low stool in front of me, holding both of my hands, and says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Now I can have a <hi rend="italics">good</hi> look at you; and, laws-a-me, I've been hungry for
      it a many and a many a time, all these long years, and it's come at last!
      We been expecting you a couple of days and more. What kep' you?—boat
      get aground?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "Yes'm—she—"
    </p>
   <p>
      "Don't say yes'm—say Aunt Sally. Where'd she get aground?"
    </p>
   <p>
      I didn't rightly know what to say, because I didn't know whether the boat
      would be coming up the river or down. But I go a good deal on
      instinct; and my instinct said she would be coming up—from down
      towards Orleans. That didn't help me much, though; for I didn't know the
      names of bars down that way. I see I'd got to invent a bar, or
      forget the name of the one we got aground on—or—Now I struck
      an idea, and fetched it out:
    </p>
   <p>
      "It warn't the grounding—that didn't keep us back but a little.
      We blowed out a cylinder-head."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Good gracious! anybody hurt?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "No'm. Killed a nigger."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Well, it's lucky; because sometimes people do get hurt. Two years
      ago last Christmas your uncle Silas was coming up from Newrleans on the
      old Lally Rook, and she blowed out a cylinder-head and crippled a man.
      And I think he died afterwards. He was a Baptist. Your
      uncle Silas knowed a family in Baton Rouge that knowed his people very
      well. Yes, I remember now, he <hi rend="italics">did</hi> die. Mortification set in,
      and they had to amputate him. But it didn't save him. Yes, it was
      mortification—that was it. He turned blue all over, and died
      in the hope of a glorious resurrection. They say he was a sight to look
      at. Your uncle's been up to the town every day to fetch you. And
      he's gone again, not more'n an hour ago; he'll be back any minute now. You
      must a met him on the road, didn't you?—oldish man, with a—"
    </p>
   <p>
      "No, I didn't see nobody, Aunt Sally. The boat landed just at
      daylight, and I left my baggage on the wharf-boat and went looking around
      the town and out a piece in the country, to put in the time and not get
      here too soon; and so I come down the back way."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Who'd you give the baggage to?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "Nobody."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Why, child, it 'll be stole!"
    </p>
   <p>
      "Not where I hid it I <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckon</orig><reg>think</reg></choice></distinct> it won't," I says.
    </p>
   <p>
      "How'd you get your breakfast so early on the boat?"
    </p>
   <p>
      It was kinder thin ice, but I says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "The captain see me standing around, and told me I better have something
      to eat before I went ashore; so he took me in the texas to the officers'
      lunch, and give me all I wanted."
    </p>
   <p>
      I was getting so uneasy I couldn't listen good. I had my mind on the
      children all the time; I wanted to get them out to one side and pump them
      a little, and find out who I was. But I couldn't get no show, Mrs.
      Phelps kept it up and run on so. Pretty soon she made the cold
      chills streak all down my back, because she says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "But here we're a-running on this way, and you hain't told me a word about
      Sis, nor any of them. Now I'll rest my works a little, and you start
      up yourn; just tell me <hi rend="italics">everything</hi>—tell me all about 'm all every one
      of 'm; and how they are, and what they're doing, and what they told you to
      tell me; and every last thing you can think of."
    </p>
   <p>
      Well, I see I was up a stump—and up it good. Providence had
      stood by me this fur all right, but I was hard and tight aground now.
      I see it warn't a bit of use to try to go ahead—I'd got to
      throw up my hand. So I says to myself, here's another place where I
      got to resk the truth. I opened my mouth to begin; but she grabbed
      me and hustled me in behind the bed, and says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Here he comes! Stick your head down lower—there, that'll do;
      you can't be seen now. Don't you let on you're here. I'll play
      a joke on him. Children, don't you say a word."
    </p>
   <p>
      I see I was in a fix now. But it warn't no use to worry; there
      warn't nothing to do but just hold still, and try and be ready to stand
      from under when the lightning struck.
    </p>
   <p>
      I had just one little glimpse of the old gentleman when he come in; then
      the bed hid him. Mrs. Phelps she jumps for him, and says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Has he come?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "No," says her husband.
    </p>
   <p>
      "Good-<hi rend="italics">ness</hi> gracious!" she says, "what in the warld can have become of
      him?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "I can't imagine," says the old gentleman; "and I must say it makes me
      dreadful uneasy."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Uneasy!" she says; "I'm ready to go distracted! He <hi rend="italics">must</hi> a come; and
      you've missed him along the road. I <hi rend="italics">know</hi> it's so—something
      tells me so."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Why, Sally, I <hi rend="italics">couldn't</hi> miss him along the road—<hi rend="italics">you</hi> know that."
    </p>
   <p>
      "But oh, dear, dear, what <hi rend="italics">will</hi> Sis say! He must a come! You
      must a missed him. He—"
    </p>
   <p>
      "Oh, don't distress me any more'n I'm already distressed. I don't
      know what in the world to make of it. I'm at my wit's end, and I
      don't mind acknowledging 't I'm right down scared. But there's no
      hope that he's come; for he <hi rend="italics">couldn't</hi> come and me miss him. Sally,
      it's terrible—just terrible—something's happened to the boat,
      sure!"
    </p>
   <p>
      "Why, Silas! Look yonder!—up the road!—ain't that
      somebody coming?"
    </p>
   <p>
      He sprung to the window at the head of the bed, and that give Mrs. Phelps
      the chance she wanted. She stooped down quick at the foot of the bed
      and give me a pull, and out I come; and when he turned back from the
      window there she stood, a-beaming and a-smiling like a house afire, and I
      standing pretty meek and sweaty alongside. The old gentleman stared,
      and says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Why, who's that?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "Who do you <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckon</orig><reg>think</reg></choice></distinct> 't is?"
    </p>
   <p>

    </p>
   <p>
      "I hain't no idea. Who <hi rend="italics">is</hi> it?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "It's <hi rend="italics"><rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom Sawyer</rs></hi>"
    </p>
   <p>
      By jings, I most slumped through the floor! But there warn't no time
      to swap knives; the old man grabbed me by the hand and shook, and kept on
      shaking; and all the time how the woman did dance around and laugh and
      cry; and then how they both did fire off questions about Sid, and Mary,
      and the rest of the tribe.
    </p>
   <p>
      But if they was joyful, it warn't nothing to what I was; for it was like
      being born again, I was so glad to find out who I was. Well, they
      froze to me for two hours; and at last, when my chin was so tired it
      couldn't hardly go any more, I had told them more about my family—I
      mean the Sawyer family—than ever happened to any six Sawyer
      families. And I explained all about how we blowed out a
      cylinder-head at the mouth of White River, and it took us three days to
      fix it. Which was all right, and worked first-rate; because <hi rend="italics">they</hi>
      didn't know but what it would take three days to fix it. If I'd a
      called it a bolthead it would a done just as well.
    </p>
   <p>
      Now I was feeling pretty comfortable all down one side, and pretty
      uncomfortable all up the other. Being <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom Sawyer</rs>was easy and
      comfortable, and it stayed easy and comfortable till by and by I hear a
      steamboat coughing along down the river. Then I says to myself,
      s'pose <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom Sawyer</rs>comes down on that boat? And s'pose he steps in
      here any minute, and sings out my name before I can throw him a wink to
      keep quiet?
    </p>
   <p>
      Well, I couldn't <hi rend="italics">have</hi> it that way; it wouldn't do at all. I must go
      up the road and waylay him. So I told the folks I <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckoned</orig><reg>thought</reg></choice></distinct> I would
      go up to the town and fetch down my baggage. The old gentleman was
      for going along with me, but I said no, I could drive the horse myself,
      and I druther he wouldn't take no trouble about me.

<div type="chapter" xml:id="ch21_hf">
   <p>
      SO I started for town in the wagon, and when I was half-way I see a wagon
      coming, and sure enough it was <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom Sawyer</rs> and I stopped and waited till
      he come along. I says "Hold on!" and it stopped alongside, and his
      mouth opened up like a trunk, and stayed so; and he swallowed two or three
      times like a person that's got a dry throat, and then says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "I hain't ever done you no harm. You know that. So, then, what
      you want to come back and ha'nt <hi rend="italics">me</hi> for?"
    </p>
   <p>
      I says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "I hain't come back—I hain't been <hi rend="italics">gone</hi>."
    </p>
   <p>
      When he heard my voice it righted him up some, but he warn't quite
      satisfied yet. He says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Don't you play nothing on me, because I wouldn't on you. Honest
      injun now, you ain't a ghost?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "Honest injun, I ain't," I says.
    </p>
   <p>
      "Well—I—I—well, that ought to settle it, of course; but
      I can't somehow seem to understand it no way. Looky here, warn't you
      ever murdered <hi rend="italics">at all?</hi>"
    </p>
   <p>
      "No. I warn't ever murdered at all—I played it on them. You
      come in here and feel of me if you don't believe me."
    </p>
   <p>
      So he done it; and it satisfied him; and he was that glad to see me again
      he didn't know what to do. And he wanted to know all about it right
      off, because it was a grand adventure, and mysterious, and so it hit him
      where he lived. But I said, leave it alone till by and by; and told
      his driver to wait, and we drove off a little piece, and I told him the
      kind of a fix I was in, and what did he <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckon</orig><reg>think</reg></choice></distinct> we better do? He
      said, let him alone a minute, and don't disturb him. So he thought
      and thought, and pretty soon he says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "It's all right; I've got it. Take my trunk in your wagon, and let
      on it's your'n; and you turn back and fool along slow, so as to get to the
      house about the time you ought to; and I'll go towards town a piece, and
      take a fresh start, and get there a quarter or a half an hour after you;
      and you needn't let on to know me at first."
    </p>
   <p>
      I says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "All right; but wait a minute. There's one more thing—a thing
      that <hi rend="italics">nobody</hi> don't know but me. And that is, there's a nigger here
      that I'm a-trying to steal out of slavery, and his name is <hi rend="italics">Jim</hi>—old
      Miss Watson's <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs>."
    </p>
   <p>
      He says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "What! Why, <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> is—"
    </p>
   <p>
      He stopped and went to studying. I says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "I know what you'll say. You'll say it's dirty, low-down business;
      but what if it is? I'm low down; and I'm a-going to steal him, and I
      want you keep mum and not let on. Will you?"
    </p>
   <p>
      His eye lit up, and he says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "I'll <hi rend="italics">help</hi> you steal him!"
    </p>
   <p>
      Well, I let go all holts then, like I was shot. It was the most
      astonishing speech I ever heard—and I'm bound to say <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom Sawyer</rs>fell
      considerable in my estimation. Only I couldn't believe it. Tom
      Sawyer a <hi rend="italics">nigger-stealer!</hi>
    </p>
   <p>
      "Oh, shucks!" I says; "you're joking."
    </p>
   <p>
      "I ain't joking, either."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Well, then," I says, "joking or no joking, if you hear anything said
      about a runaway nigger, don't forget to remember that <hi rend="italics">you</hi> don't know
      nothing about him, and I don't know nothing about him."
    </p>
   <p>
      Then we took the trunk and put it in my wagon, and he drove off his way
      and I drove mine. But of course I forgot all about driving slow on
      accounts of being glad and full of thinking; so I got home a heap too
      quick for that length of a trip. The old gentleman was at the door,
      and he says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Why, this is wonderful! Whoever would a thought it was in that mare
      to do it? I wish we'd a timed her. And she hain't sweated a
      hair—not a hair. It's wonderful. Why, I wouldn't take a
      hundred dollars for that horse now—I wouldn't, honest; and yet I'd a
      sold her for fifteen before, and thought 'twas all she was worth."
    </p>
   <p>
      That's all he said. He was the innocentest, best old soul I ever
      see. But it warn't surprising; because he warn't only just a farmer, he
      was a preacher, too, and had a little one-horse log church down back of
      the plantation, which he built it himself at his own expense, for a church
      and schoolhouse, and never charged nothing for his preaching, and it was
      worth it, too. There was plenty other farmer-preachers like that,
      and done the same way, down South.
    </p>
   <p>
      In about half an hour Tom's wagon drove up to the front stile, and Aunt
      Sally she see it through the window, because it was only about fifty
      yards, and says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Why, there's somebody come! I wonder who 'tis? Why, I do
      believe it's a stranger. Jimmy" (that's one of the children) "run
      and tell Lize to put on another plate for dinner."
    </p>
   <p>
      Everybody made a rush for the front door, because, of course, a stranger
      don't come <hi rend="italics">every</hi> year, and so he lays over the yaller-fever, for interest,
      when he does come. Tom was over the stile and starting for the
      house; the wagon was spinning up the road for the village, and we was all
      bunched in the front door. <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom</rs> ad his store clothes on, and an
      audience—and that was always nuts for <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom Sawyer</rs> In them
      circumstances it warn't no trouble to him to throw in an amount of style
      that was suitable. He warn't a boy to meeky along up that yard like
      a sheep; no, he come ca'm and important, like the ram. When he got
      a-front of us he lifts his hat ever so gracious and dainty, like it was
      the lid of a box that had butterflies asleep in it and he didn't want to
      disturb them, and says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Mr. Archibald Nichols, I presume?"
    </p>
   <p>
        
    </p>

      <graphic url="media/c33-287.jpg"/>
      <lb/>
    </figure>
   <p>
       <lb/>
    </p>
   <p>
      "No, my boy," says the old gentleman, "I'm sorry to say 't your driver has
      deceived you; Nichols's place is down a matter of three mile more. Come
      in, come in."
    </p>
   <p>
      <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom</rs> e took a look back over his shoulder, and says, "Too late—he's
      out of sight."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Yes, he's gone, my son, and you must come in and eat your dinner with us;
      and then we'll hitch up and take you down to Nichols's."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Oh, I <hi rend="italics">can't</hi> make you so much trouble; I couldn't think of it. I'll
      walk—I don't mind the distance."
    </p>
   <p>
      "But we won't <hi rend="italics">let</hi> you walk—it wouldn't be Southern hospitality to do
      it. Come right in."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Oh, <hi rend="italics">do</hi>," says Aunt Sally; "it ain't a bit of trouble to us, not a bit in
      the world. You must stay. It's a long, dusty three mile, and
      we can't let you walk. And, besides, I've already told 'em to put on
      another plate when I see you coming; so you mustn't disappoint us. Come
      right in and make yourself at home."
    </p>
   <p>
      So <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom</rs> e thanked them very hearty and handsome, and let himself be
      persuaded, and come in; and when he was in he said he was a stranger from
      Hicksville, Ohio, and his name was William Thompson—and he made
      another bow.
    </p>

      Well, he run on, and on, and on, making up stuff about Hicksville and
      everybody in it he could invent, and I getting a little nervious, and
      wondering how this was going to help me out of my scrape; and at last,
      still talking along, he reached over and kissed Aunt Sally right on the
      mouth, and then settled back again in his chair comfortable, and was going
      on talking; but she jumped up and wiped it off with the back of her hand,
      and says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "You owdacious puppy!"
    </p>
   <p>
      He looked kind of hurt, and says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "I'm surprised at you, m'am."
    </p>
   <p>
      "You're s'rp—Why, what do you <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckon</orig><reg>think</reg></choice></distinct> I am? I've a good notion
      to take and—Say, what do you mean by kissing me?"
    </p>
   <p>
      He looked kind of humble, and says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "I didn't mean nothing, m'am. I didn't mean no harm. I—I—thought
      you'd like it."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Why, you born fool!" She took up the spinning stick, and it looked
      like it was all she could do to keep from giving him a crack with it.
      "What made you think I'd like it?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "Well, I don't know. Only, they—they—told me you would."
    </p>
   <p>
      "<hi rend="italics">They</hi> told you I would. Whoever told you's <hi rend="italics">another</hi> lunatic. I
      never heard the beat of it. Who's <hi rend="italics">they</hi>?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "Why, everybody. They all said so, m'am."
    </p>
   <p>
      It was all she could do to hold in; and her eyes snapped, and her fingers
      worked like she wanted to scratch him; and she says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Who's 'everybody'? Out with their names, or ther'll be an idiot
      short."
    </p>
   <p>
      He got up and looked distressed, and fumbled his hat, and says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "I'm sorry, and I warn't expecting it. They told me to. They
      all told me to. They all said, kiss her; and said she'd like it.
      They all said it—every one of them. But I'm sorry, m'am,
      and I won't do it no more—I won't, honest."
    </p>
   <p>
      "You won't, won't you? Well, I sh'd <hi rend="italics"><distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckon</orig><reg>think</reg></choice></distinct></hi> you won't!"
    </p>
   <p>
      "No'm, I'm honest about it; I won't ever do it again—till you ask
      me."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Till I <hi rend="italics">ask</hi> you! Well, I never see the beat of it in my born days!
      I lay you'll be the Methusalem-numskull of creation before ever I
      ask you—or the likes of you."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Well," he says, "it does surprise me so. I can't make it out,
      somehow. They said you would, and I thought you would. But—"
      He stopped and looked around slow, like he wished he could run across a
      friendly eye somewheres, and fetched up on the old gentleman's, and says,
      "Didn't <hi rend="italics">you</hi> think she'd like me to kiss her, sir?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "Why, no; I—I—well, no, I b'lieve I didn't."
    </p>
   <p>
      Then he looks on around the same way to me, and says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Tom, didn't <hi rend="italics">you</hi> think Aunt Sally 'd open out her arms and say, 'Sid
      Sawyer—'"
    </p>
   <p>
      "My land!" she says, breaking in and jumping for him, "you impudent young
      rascal, to fool <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>a body</orig><reg>somebody</reg></choice></distinct> so—" and was going to hug him, but he fended
      her off, and says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "No, not till you've asked me first."
    </p>
   <p>
      So she didn't lose no time, but asked him; and hugged him and kissed him
      over and over again, and then turned him over to the old man, and he took
      what was left. And after they got a little quiet again she says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Why, dear me, I never see such a surprise. We warn't looking for
      <hi rend="italics">you</hi> at all, but only Tom. Sis never wrote to me about anybody coming
      but him."
    </p>
   <p>
      "It's because it warn't <hi rend="italics">intended</hi> for any of us to come but Tom," he says;
      "but I begged and begged, and at the last minute she let me come, too; so,
      coming down the river, me and <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom</rs> hought it would be a first-rate
      surprise for him to come here to the house first, and for me to by and by
      tag along and drop in, and let on to be a stranger. But it was a
      mistake, Aunt Sally. This ain't no healthy place for a stranger to
      come."
    </p>
   <p>
      "No—not impudent whelps, Sid. You ought to had your jaws
      boxed; I hain't been so put out since I don't know when. But I don't
      care, I don't mind the terms—I'd be willing to stand a thousand such
      jokes to have you here. Well, to think of that performance! I don't
      deny it, I was most putrified with astonishment when you give me that
      smack."

      We had dinner out in that broad open passage betwixt the house and the
      kitchen; and there was things enough on that table for seven families—and
      all hot, too; none of your flabby, tough meat that's laid in a cupboard in
      a damp cellar all night and tastes like a hunk of old cold cannibal in the
      morning. Uncle Silas he asked a pretty long blessing over it, but it
      was worth it; and it didn't cool it a bit, neither, the way I've seen them
      kind of interruptions do lots of times. There was a considerable
      good deal of talk all the afternoon, and me and Tom was on the lookout all
      the time; but it warn't no use, they didn't happen to say nothing about
      any runaway nigger, and we was afraid to try to work up to it. But
      at supper, at night, one of the little boys says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Pa, mayn't Tom and Sid and me go to the show?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "No," says the old man, "I <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckon</orig><reg>think</reg></choice></distinct> there ain't going to be any; and you
      couldn't go if there was; because the runaway nigger told Burton and me
      all about that scandalous show, and Burton said he would tell the people;
      so I <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckon</orig><reg>think</reg></choice></distinct> they've drove the owdacious loafers out of town before this
      time."
    </p>
   <p>
      So there it was!—but I couldn't help it. Tom and me was to
      sleep in the same room and bed; so, being tired, we bid good-night and
      went up to bed right after supper, and clumb out of the window and down
      the lightning-rod, and shoved for the town; for I didn't believe anybody
      was going to give the king and <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_the_duke">the duke</rs> a hint, and so if I didn't hurry
      up and give them one they'd get into trouble sure.
    </p>
   <p>
      On the road <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom</rs> e told me all about how it was <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckoned</orig><reg>thought</reg></choice></distinct> I was murdered,
      and how pap disappeared pretty soon, and didn't come back no more, and
      what a stir there was when <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> run away; and I told Tom all about our
      Royal Nonesuch rapscallions, and as much of the raft voyage as I had time
      to; and as we struck into the town and up through the the middle of it--it
      was as much as half-after eight, then—here comes a raging rush of
      people with torches, and an awful whooping and yelling, and banging tin
      pans and blowing horns; and we jumped to one side to let them go by; and
      as they went by I see they had the king and <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_the_duke">the duke</rs> astraddle of a rail—that
      is, I knowed it <hi rend="italics">was</hi> the king and the duke, though they was all over tar
      and feathers, and didn't look like nothing in the world that was human—just
      looked like a couple of monstrous big soldier-plumes. Well, it made
      me sick to see it; and I was sorry for them poor pitiful rascals, it
      seemed like I couldn't ever feel any hardness against them any more in the
      world. It was a dreadful thing to see. Human beings <hi rend="italics">can</hi> be
      awful cruel to one another.
    </p>

   <p>
      We see we was too late—couldn't do no good. We asked some
      stragglers about it, and they said everybody went to the show looking very
      innocent; and laid low and kept dark till the poor old king was in the
      middle of his cavortings on the stage; then somebody give a signal, and
      the house rose up and went for them.
    </p>
   <p>
      So we poked along back home, and I warn't feeling so brash as I was
      before, but kind of ornery, and humble, and to blame, somehow—though
      I hadn't done nothing. But that's always the way; it don't make no
      difference whether you do right or wrong, a person's conscience ain't got
      no sense, and just goes for him anyway. If I had a yaller dog that
      didn't know no more than a person's conscience does I would pison him. It
      takes up more room than all the rest of a person's insides, and yet ain't
      no good, nohow. <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom Sawyer</rs>he says the same.

<div type="chapter" xml:id="ch22_hf">
   <p>
      WE stopped talking, and got to thinking. By and by <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom</rs> ays:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Looky here, Huck, what fools we are to not think of it before! I
      bet I know where <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> is."
    </p>
   <p>
      "No! Where?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "In that hut down by the ash-hopper. Why, looky here. When we
      was at dinner, didn't you see a nigger man go in there with some vittles?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
   <p>
      "What did you think the vittles was for?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "For a dog."
    </p>
   <p>
      "So 'd I. Well, it wasn't for a dog."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Why?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "Because part of it was watermelon."
    </p>
   <p>
      "So it was—I noticed it. Well, it does beat all that I never
      thought about a dog not eating watermelon. It shows how <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>a body</orig><reg>somebody</reg></choice></distinct> can
      see and don't see at the same time."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Well, the nigger unlocked the padlock when he went in, and he locked it
      again when he came out. He fetched uncle a key about the time we got
      up from table—same key, I bet. Watermelon shows man, lock
      shows prisoner; and it ain't likely there's two prisoners on such a little
      plantation, and where the people's all so kind and good. Jim's the
      prisoner. All right—I'm glad we found it out detective
      fashion; I wouldn't give shucks for any other way. Now you work your
      mind, and study out a plan to steal Jim, and I will study out one, too;
      and we'll take the one we like the best."
    </p>
   <p>
      What a head for just a boy to have! If I had Tom Sawyer's head I
      wouldn't trade it off to be a duke, nor mate of a steamboat, nor clown in
      a circus, nor nothing I can think of. I went to thinking out a plan,
      but only just to be doing something; I knowed very well where the right
      plan was going to come from. Pretty soon <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom</rs> ays:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Ready?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "Yes," I says.
    </p>
   <p>
      "All right—bring it out."
    </p>
   <p>
      "My plan is this," I says. "We can easy find out if it's <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> in
      there. Then get up my canoe to-morrow night, and fetch my raft over from
      the island. Then the first dark night that comes steal the key out
      of the old man's britches after he goes to bed, and shove off down the
      river on the raft with Jim, hiding daytimes and running nights, the way me
      and <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> used to do before. Wouldn't that plan work?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "<hi rend="italics">Work</hi>? Why, cert'nly it would work, like rats a-fighting. But
      it's too blame' simple; there ain't nothing <hi rend="italics">to</hi> it. What's the good
      of a plan that ain't no more trouble than that? It's as mild as
      goose-milk. Why, Huck, it wouldn't make no more talk than breaking
      into a soap factory."
    </p>
   <p>
      I never said nothing, because I warn't expecting nothing different; but I
      knowed mighty well that whenever he got <hi rend="italics">his</hi> plan ready it wouldn't have
      none of them objections to it.
    </p>
   <p>
      And it didn't. He told me what it was, and I see in a minute it was
      worth fifteen of mine for style, and would make <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> just as free a man as
      mine would, and maybe get us all killed besides. So I was satisfied,
      and said we would waltz in on it. I needn't tell what it was here,
      because I knowed it wouldn't stay the way, it was. I knowed he would
      be changing it around every which way as we went along, and heaving in new
      bullinesses wherever he got a chance. And that is what he done.
    </p>
   <p>
      Well, one thing was dead sure, and that was that <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom Sawyer</rs>was in
      earnest, and was actuly going to help steal that nigger out of slavery.
      That was the thing that was too many for me. Here was a boy that was
      respectable and well brung up; and had a character to lose; and folks at
      home that had characters; and he was bright and not leather-headed; and
      knowing and not ignorant; and not mean, but kind; and yet here he was,
      without any more pride, or rightness, or feeling, than to stoop to this
      business, and make himself a shame, and his family a shame, before
      everybody. I <hi rend="italics">couldn't</hi> understand it no way at all. It was
      outrageous, and I knowed I ought to just up and tell him so; and so be his
      true friend, and let him quit the thing right where he was and save
      himself. And I <hi rend="italics">did</hi> start to tell him; but he shut me up, and says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Don't you <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckon</orig><reg>think</reg></choice></distinct> I know what I'm about? Don't I generly know what
      I'm about?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Didn't I <hi rend="italics">say</hi> I was going to help steal the nigger?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
   <p>
      "<hi rend="italics">Well</hi>, then."
    </p>
   <p>
      That's all he said, and that's all I said. It warn't no use to say
      any more; because when he said he'd do a thing, he always done it. But
      I couldn't make out how he was willing to go into this thing; so I just
      let it go, and never bothered no more about it. If he was bound to
      have it so, I couldn't help it.
    </p>
   <p>
      When we got home the house was all dark and still; so we went on down to
      the hut by the ash-hopper for to examine it. We went through the
      yard so as to see what the hounds would do. They knowed us, and
      didn't make no more noise than country dogs is always doing when anything
      comes by in the night. When we got to the cabin we took a look at
      the front and the two sides; and on the side I warn't acquainted with—which
      was the north side—we found a square window-hole, up tolerable high,
      with just one stout board nailed across it. I says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Here's the ticket. This hole's big enough for <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> to get through if
      we wrench off the board."
    </p>
   <p>
      <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom</rs> ays:
    </p>
   <p>
      "It's as simple as tit-tat-toe, three-in-a-row, and as easy as playing
      hooky. I should <hi rend="italics">hope</hi> we can find a way that's a little more
      complicated than <hi rend="italics">that</hi>, Huck Finn."
    </p>

   <p>
       <lb/>
    </p>
   <p>
      "Well, then," I says, "how 'll it do to saw him out, the way I done before
      I was murdered that time?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "That's more <hi rend="italics">like</hi>," he says. "It's real mysterious, and troublesome,
      and good," he says; "but I bet we can find a way that's twice as long.
      There ain't no hurry; le's keep on looking around."
    </p>
   <p>
      Betwixt the hut and the fence, on the back side, was a lean-to that joined
      the hut at the eaves, and was made out of plank. It was as long as
      the hut, but narrow—only about six foot wide. The door to it
      was at the south end, and was padlocked. <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom</rs> e went to the
      soap-kettle and searched around, and fetched back the iron thing they lift
      the lid with; so he took it and prized out one of the staples. The
      chain fell down, and we opened the door and went in, and shut it, and
      struck a match, and see the shed was only built against a cabin and hadn't
      no connection with it; and there warn't no floor to the shed, nor nothing
      in it but some old rusty played-out hoes and spades and picks and a
      crippled plow. The match went out, and so did we, and shoved in the
      staple again, and the door was locked as good as ever. Tom was joyful.
      He says;
    </p>
   <p>
      "Now we're all right. We'll <hi rend="italics">dig</hi> him out. It 'll take about a
      week!"
    </p>
   <p>
      Then we started for the house, and I went in the back door—you only
      have to pull a buckskin latch-string, they don't fasten the doors—but
      that warn't romantical enough for <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom Sawyer</rs> no way would do him but he
      must climb up the lightning-rod. But after he got up half way about
      three times, and missed fire and fell every time, and the last time most
      busted his brains out, he thought he'd got to give it up; but after he was
      rested he allowed he would give her one more turn for luck, and this time
      he made the trip.
    </p>
   <p>
      In the morning we was up at break of day, and down to the nigger cabins to
      pet the dogs and make friends with the nigger that fed Jim—if it <hi rend="italics">was</hi>
      <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> that was being fed. The niggers was just getting through
      breakfast and starting for the fields; and Jim's nigger was piling up a
      tin pan with bread and meat and things; and whilst the others was leaving,
      the key come from the house.
    </p>
   <p>
      This nigger had a good-natured, chuckle-headed face, and his wool was all
      tied up in little bunches with thread. That was to keep witches off.
      He said the witches was pestering him awful these nights, and making
      him see all kinds of strange things, and hear all kinds of strange words
      and noises, and he didn't believe he was ever witched so long before in
      his life. He got so worked up, and got to running on so about his
      troubles, he forgot all about what he'd been a-going to do. So Tom
      says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "What's the vittles for? Going to feed the dogs?"
    </p>
   <p>
      The nigger kind of smiled around gradually over his face, like when you
      heave a brickbat in a mud-puddle, and he says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Yes, Mars Sid, A dog. Cur'us dog, too. Does you want to go en
      look at 'im?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
   <p>
      I hunched Tom, and whispers:
    </p>
   <p>
      "You going, right here in the daybreak? <hi rend="italics">that</hi> warn't the plan."
    </p>
   <p>
      "No, it warn't; but it's the plan <hi rend="italics">now</hi>."
    </p>
   <p>
      So, drat him, we went along, but I didn't like it much. When we got
      in we couldn't hardly see anything, it was so dark; but <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> was there,
      sure enough, and could see us; and he sings out:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Why, <hi rend="italics">Huck</hi>! En good <hi rend="italics">lan</hi>'! ain' dat Misto Tom?"
    </p>
   <p>
      I just knowed how it would be; I just expected it. I didn't know
      nothing to do; and if I had I couldn't a done it, because that nigger
      busted in and says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Why, de gracious sakes! do he know you genlmen?"
    </p>
   <p>
      We could see pretty well now. <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom</rs> e looked at the nigger, steady
      and kind of wondering, and says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Does <hi rend="italics">who</hi> know us?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "Why, dis-yer runaway nigger."
    </p>
   <p>
      "I don't <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckon</orig><reg>think</reg></choice></distinct> he does; but what put that into your head?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "What <hi rend="italics">put</hi> it dar? Didn' he jis' dis minute sing out like he knowed
      you?"
    </p>
   <p>
      <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom</rs> ays, in a puzzled-up kind of way:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Well, that's mighty curious. <hi rend="italics">Who</hi> sung out? <hi rend="italics">when</hi> did he sing out?
      <hi rend="italics">what</hi> did he sing out?" And turns to me, perfectly ca'm, and says,
      "Did <hi rend="italics">you</hi> hear anybody sing out?"
    </p>
   <p>
      Of course there warn't nothing to be said but the one thing; so I says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "No; I ain't heard nobody say nothing."
    </p>
   <p>
      Then he turns to Jim, and looks him over like he never see him before, and
      says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Did you sing out?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "No, sah," says Jim; "I hain't said nothing, sah."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Not a word?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "No, sah, I hain't said a word."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Did you ever see us before?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "No, sah; not as I knows on."
    </p>
   <p>
      So <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom</rs> urns to the nigger, which was looking wild and distressed, and
      says, kind of severe:
    </p>
   <p>
      "What do you <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckon</orig><reg>think</reg></choice></distinct>'s the matter with you, anyway? What made you
      think somebody sung out?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "Oh, it's de dad-blame' witches, sah, en I wisht I was dead, I do. Dey's
      awluz at it, sah, en dey do mos' kill me, dey sk'yers me so. Please
      to don't tell nobody 'bout it sah, er ole Mars Silas he'll scole me; 'kase
      he say dey <hi rend="italics">ain't</hi> no witches. I jis' wish to goodness he was heah now—<hi rend="italics">den</hi>
      what would he say! I jis' bet he couldn' fine no way to git aroun'

      dey won't look into noth'n'en fine it out f'r deyselves, en when <hi rend="italics">you</hi> fine

      <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom</rs> ive him a dime, and said we wouldn't tell nobody; and told him to buy
      some more thread to tie up his wool with; and then looks at Jim, and says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "I wonder if Uncle Silas is going to hang this nigger. If I was to
      catch a nigger that was ungrateful enough to run away, I wouldn't give him
      up, I'd hang him." And whilst the nigger stepped to the door to look
      at the dime and bite it to see if it was good, he whispers to <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> and
      says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Don't ever let on to know us. And if you hear any digging going on
      nights, it's us; we're going to set you free."
    </p>
   <p>
      <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> only had time to grab us by the hand and squeeze it; then the nigger
      come back, and we said we'd come again some time if the nigger wanted us
      to; and he said he would, more particular if it was dark, because the
      witches went for him mostly in the dark, and it was good to have folks
      around then.

      IT would be most an hour yet till breakfast, so we left and struck down
      into the woods; because <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom</rs> aid we got to have <hi rend="italics">some</hi> light to see how to
      dig by, and a lantern makes too much, and might get us into trouble; what
      we must have was a lot of them rotten chunks that's called fox-fire, and
      just makes a soft kind of a glow when you lay them in a dark place. We
      fetched an armful and hid it in the weeds, and set down to rest, and Tom
      says, kind of dissatisfied:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Blame it, this whole thing is just as easy and awkward as it can be. And
      so it makes it so rotten difficult to get up a difficult plan. There
      ain't no watchman to be drugged—now there <hi rend="italics">ought</hi> to be a watchman.
      There ain't even a dog to give a sleeping-mixture to. And
      there's <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> chained by one leg, with a ten-foot chain, to the leg of his
      bed: why, all you got to do is to lift up the bedstead and slip off
      the chain. And Uncle Silas he trusts everybody; sends the key to the
      punkin-headed nigger, and don't send nobody to watch the nigger. Jim
      could a got out of that window-hole before this, only there wouldn't be no
      use trying to travel with a ten-foot chain on his leg. Why, drat it,
      Huck, it's the stupidest arrangement I ever see. You got to invent <hi rend="italics">all</hi> the
      difficulties. Well, we can't help it; we got to do the best we can
      with the materials we've got. Anyhow, there's one thing—there's more
      honor in getting him out through a lot of difficulties and dangers, where
      there warn't one of them furnished to you by the people who it was their
      duty to furnish them, and you had to contrive them all out of your own
      head. Now look at just that one thing of the lantern. When you
      come down to the cold facts, we simply got to <hi rend="italics">let on</hi> that a lantern's
      resky. Why, we could work with a torchlight procession if we wanted
      to, I believe. Now, whilst I think of it, we got to hunt up
      something to make a saw out of the first chance we get."
    </p>
   <p>
      "What do we want of a saw?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "What do we <hi rend="italics">want</hi> of it? Hain't we got to saw the leg of Jim's bed
      off, so as to get the chain loose?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "Why, you just said <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>a body</orig><reg>somebody</reg></choice></distinct> could lift up the bedstead and slip the chain
      off."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Well, if that ain't just like you, Huck Finn. You <hi rend="italics">can</hi> get up the
      infant-schooliest ways of going at a thing. Why, hain't you ever
      read any books at all?—Baron Trenck, nor Casanova, nor Benvenuto
      Chelleeny, nor Henri IV., nor none of them heroes? Who ever heard of
      getting a prisoner loose in such an old-maidy way as that? No; the
      way all the best authorities does is to saw the bed-leg in two, and leave
      it just so, and swallow the sawdust, so it can't be found, and put some
      dirt and grease around the sawed place so the very keenest seneskal can't
      see no sign of it's being sawed, and thinks the bed-leg is perfectly
      sound. Then, the night you're ready, fetch the leg a kick, down she goes;
      slip off your chain, and there you are. Nothing to do but hitch your
      rope ladder to the battlements, shin down it, break your leg in the moat—because
      a rope ladder is nineteen foot too short, you know—and there's your
      horses and your trusty vassles, and they scoop you up and fling you across
      a saddle, and away you go to your native Langudoc, or Navarre, or wherever
      it is. It's gaudy, Huck. I wish there was a moat to this cabin. If
      we get time, the night of the escape, we'll dig one."
    </p>
   <p>
      I says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "What do we want of a moat when we're going to snake him out from under
      the cabin?"
    </p>
   <p>
      But he never heard me. He had forgot me and everything else. He
      had his chin in his hand, thinking. Pretty soon he sighs and shakes
      his head; then sighs again, and says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "No, it wouldn't do—there ain't necessity enough for it."
    </p>
   <p>
      "For what?" I says.
    </p>
   <p>
      "Why, to saw Jim's leg off," he says.
    </p>
   <p>
      "Good land!" I says; "why, there ain't <hi rend="italics">no</hi> necessity for it. And
      what would you want to saw his leg off for, anyway?"
    </p>

   <p>
      "Well, some of the best authorities has done it. They couldn't get
      the chain off, so they just cut their hand off and shoved. And a leg
      would be better still. But we got to let that go. There ain't
      necessity enough in this case; and, besides, Jim's a nigger, and wouldn't
      understand the reasons for it, and how it's the custom in Europe; so we'll
      let it go. But there's one thing—he can have a rope ladder; we
      can tear up our sheets and make him a rope ladder easy enough. And
      we can send it to him in a pie; it's mostly done that way. And I've
      et worse pies."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Why, <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom Sawyer</rs> how you talk," I says; "<rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> ain't got no use for a rope
      ladder."
    </p>
   <p>
      "He <hi rend="italics">has</hi> got use for it. How <hi rend="italics">you</hi> talk, you better say; you don't know
      nothing about it. He's <hi rend="italics">got</hi> to have a rope ladder; they all do."
    </p>
   <p>
      "What in the nation can he <hi rend="italics">do</hi> with it?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "<hi rend="italics">Do</hi> with it? He can hide it in his bed, can't he?" That's what
      they all do; and <hi rend="italics">he's</hi> got to, too. Huck, you don't ever seem to want
      to do anything that's regular; you want to be starting something fresh all
      the time. S'pose he <hi rend="italics">don't</hi> do nothing with it? ain't it there in his bed,
      for a clew, after he's gone? and don't you <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckon</orig><reg>think</reg></choice></distinct> they'll want clews?
      Of course they will. And you wouldn't leave them any? That
      would be a <hi rend="italics">pretty</hi> howdy-do, <hi rend="italics">wouldn't</hi> it! I never heard of such a
      thing."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Well," I says, "if it's in the regulations, and he's got to have it, all
      right, let him have it; because I don't wish to go back on no regulations;
      but there's one thing, <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom Sawyer</rs>if we go to tearing up our sheets
      to make <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> a rope ladder, we're going to get into trouble with Aunt
      Sally, just as sure as you're born. Now, the way I look at it, a
      hickry-bark ladder don't cost nothing, and don't waste nothing, and is
      just as good to load up a pie with, and hide in a straw tick, as any rag
      ladder you can start; and as for Jim, he ain't had no experience, and so
      he don't care what kind of a—"
    </p>
   <p>
      "Oh, shucks, Huck Finn, if I was as ignorant as you I'd keep still—that's
      what I'D do. Who ever heard of a state prisoner escaping by a
      hickry-bark ladder? Why, it's perfectly ridiculous."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Well, all right, Tom, fix it your own way; but if you'll take my advice,
      you'll let me borrow a sheet off of the clothesline."
    </p>
   <p>
      He said that would do. And that gave him another idea, and he says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Borrow a shirt, too."
    </p>
   <p>
      "What do we want of a shirt, Tom?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "Want it for <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> to keep a journal on."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Journal your granny—<hi rend="italics">Jim</hi> can't write."
    </p>
   <p>
      "S'pose he <hi rend="italics">can't</hi> write—he can make marks on the shirt, can't he, if
      we make him a pen out of an old pewter spoon or a piece of an old iron
      barrel-hoop?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "Why, Tom, we can pull a feather out of a goose and make him a better one;
      and quicker, too."
    </p>
   <p>
      "<hi rend="italics">Prisoners</hi> don't have geese running around the donjon-keep to pull pens
      out of, you muggins. They <hi rend="italics">always</hi> make their pens out of the hardest,
      toughest, troublesomest piece of old brass candlestick or something like
      that they can get their hands on; and it takes them weeks and weeks and
      months and months to file it out, too, because they've got to do it by
      rubbing it on the wall. <hi rend="italics">They</hi> wouldn't use a goose-quill if they had
      it. It ain't regular."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Well, then, what'll we make him the ink out of?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "Many makes it out of iron-rust and tears; but that's the common sort and
      women; the best authorities uses their own blood. <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> can do that;
      and when he wants to send any little common ordinary mysterious message to
      let the world know where he's captivated, he can write it on the bottom of
      a tin plate with a fork and throw it out of the window. The Iron
      Mask always done that, and it's a blame' good way, too."
    </p>
   <p>
      "<rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> ain't got no tin plates. They feed him in a pan."
    </p>
   <p>
      "That ain't nothing; we can get him some."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Can't nobody <hi rend="italics">read</hi> his plates."
    </p>
   <p>
      "That ain't got anything to <hi rend="italics">do</hi> with it, Huck Finn. All <hi rend="italics">he's</hi> got to
      do is to write on the plate and throw it out. You don't <hi rend="italics">have</hi> to be
      able to read it. Why, half the time you can't read anything a prisoner
      writes on a tin plate, or anywhere else."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Well, then, what's the sense in wasting the plates?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "Why, blame it all, it ain't the <hi rend="italics">prisoner's</hi> plates."
    </p>
   <p>
      "But it's <hi rend="italics">somebody's</hi> plates, ain't it?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "Well, spos'n it is? What does the <hi rend="italics">prisoner</hi> care whose—"

      He broke off there, because we heard the breakfast-horn blowing. So
      we cleared out for the house.

   <p>
      Along during the morning I borrowed a sheet and a white shirt off of the
      clothes-line; and I found an old sack and put them in it, and we went down
      and got the fox-fire, and put that in too. I called it borrowing,
      because that was what pap always called it; but <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom</rs> aid it warn't
      borrowing, it was stealing. He said we was representing prisoners;
      and prisoners don't care how they get a thing so they get it, and nobody
      don't blame them for it, either. It ain't no crime in a prisoner to
      steal the thing he needs to get away with, <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom</rs> aid; it's his right; and
      so, as long as we was representing a prisoner, we had a perfect right to
      steal anything on this place we had the least use for to get ourselves out
      of prison with. He said if we warn't prisoners it would be a very
      different thing, and nobody but a mean, ornery person would steal when he
      warn't a prisoner. So we allowed we would steal everything there was
      that come handy. And yet he made a mighty fuss, one day, after that,
      when I stole a watermelon out of the nigger-patch and eat it; and he made
      me go and give the niggers a dime without telling them what it was for.
      <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom</rs> aid that what he meant was, we could steal anything we <hi rend="italics">needed</hi>. Well,
      I says, I needed the watermelon. But he said I didn't need it to get
      out of prison with; there's where the difference was. He said if I'd
      a wanted it to hide a knife in, and smuggle it to <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> to kill the seneskal
      with, it would a been all right. So I let it go at that, though I
      couldn't see no advantage in my representing a prisoner if I got to set
      down and chaw over a lot of gold-leaf distinctions like that every time I
      see a chance to hog a watermelon.
    </p>
   <p>
      Well, as I was saying, we waited that morning till everybody was settled
      down to business, and nobody in sight around the yard; then <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom</rs> e carried
      the sack into the lean-to whilst I stood off a piece to keep watch. By
      and by he come out, and we went and set down on the woodpile to talk.
      He says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Everything's all right now except tools; and that's easy fixed."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Tools?" I says.
    </p>
   <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Tools for what?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "Why, to dig with. We ain't a-going to <hi rend="italics">gnaw</hi> him out, are we?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "Ain't them old crippled picks and things in there good enough to dig a
      nigger out with?" I says.
    </p>
   <p>
      He turns on me, looking pitying enough to make <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>a body</orig><reg>somebody</reg></choice></distinct> cry, and says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Huck Finn, did you <hi rend="italics">ever</hi> hear of a prisoner having picks and shovels, and
      all the modern conveniences in his wardrobe to dig himself out with?
      Now I want to ask you—if you got any reasonableness in you at
      all—what kind of a show would <hi rend="italics">that</hi> give him to be a hero? Why,
      they might as well lend him the key and done with it. Picks and
      shovels—why, they wouldn't furnish 'em to a king."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Well, then," I says, "if we don't want the picks and shovels, what do we
      want?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "A couple of case-knives."
    </p>
   <p>
      "To dig the foundations out from under that cabin with?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Confound it, it's foolish, Tom."
    </p>
   <p>
      "It don't make no difference how foolish it is, it's the <hi rend="italics">right</hi> way—and
      it's the regular way. And there ain't no <hi rend="italics">other</hi> way, that ever I
      heard of, and I've read all the books that gives any information about
      these things. They always dig out with a case-knife—and not through
      dirt, mind you; generly it's through solid rock. And it takes them
      weeks and weeks and weeks, and for ever and ever. Why, look at one
      of them prisoners in the bottom dungeon of the Castle Deef, in the harbor
      of Marseilles, that dug himself out that way; how long was <hi rend="italics">he</hi> at it, you
      <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckon</orig><reg>think</reg></choice></distinct>?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "I don't know."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Well, guess."
    </p>
   <p>
      "I don't know. A month and a half."
    </p>
   <p>
      "<hi rend="italics">Thirty-seven year</hi>—and he come out in China. <hi rend="italics">That's</hi> the kind.
      I wish the bottom of <hi rend="italics">this</hi> fortress was solid rock."
    </p>
   <p>
      "<hi rend="italics">Jim</hi> don't know nobody in China."
    </p>
   <p>
      "What's <hi rend="italics">that</hi> got to do with it? Neither did that other fellow.
      But you're always a-wandering off on a side issue. Why can't
      you stick to the main point?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "All right—I don't care where he comes out, so he <hi rend="italics">comes</hi> out; and Jim
      don't, either, I <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckon</orig><reg>think</reg></choice></distinct>. But there's one thing, anyway—Jim's
      too old to be dug out with a case-knife. He won't last."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Yes he will <hi rend="italics">last</hi>, too. You don't <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckon</orig><reg>think</reg></choice></distinct> it's going to take
      thirty-seven years to dig out through a <hi rend="italics">dirt</hi> foundation, do you?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "How long will it take, Tom?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "Well, we can't resk being as long as we ought to, because it mayn't take

      very long for Uncle Silas to hear from down there by New Orleans. He'll
      hear Jim ain't from there. Then his next move will be to advertise
      Jim, or something like that. So we can't resk being as long digging
      him out as we ought to. By rights I <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckon</orig><reg>think</reg></choice></distinct> we ought to be a couple
      of years; but we can't. Things being so uncertain, what I recommend
      is this: that we really dig right in, as quick as we can; and after
      that, we can <hi rend="italics">let on</hi>, to ourselves, that we was at it thirty-seven years.
      Then we can snatch him out and rush him away the first time there's
      an alarm. Yes, I <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckon</orig><reg>think</reg></choice></distinct> that 'll be the best way."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Now, there's <hi rend="italics">sense</hi> in that," I says. "Letting on don't cost
      nothing; letting on ain't no trouble; and if it's any object, I don't mind
      letting on we was at it a hundred and fifty year. It wouldn't strain
      me none, after I got my hand in. So I'll mosey along now, and smouch
      a couple of case-knives."

      "Smouch three," he says; "we want one to make a saw out of."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Tom, if it ain't unregular and irreligious to sejest it," I says,
      "there's an old rusty saw-blade around yonder sticking under the
      weather-boarding behind the smoke-house."
    </p>
   <p>
      He looked kind of weary and discouraged-like, and says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "It ain't no use to try to learn you nothing, Huck. Run along and
      smouch the knives—three of them." So I done it.

   <p>
      AS soon as we <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckoned</orig><reg>thought</reg></choice></distinct> everybody was asleep that night we went down the
      lightning-rod, and shut ourselves up in the lean-to, and got out our pile
      of fox-fire, and went to work. We cleared everything out of the way,
      about four or five foot along the middle of the bottom log. <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom</rs> aid
      he was right behind Jim's bed now, and we'd dig in under it, and when we
      got through there couldn't nobody in the cabin ever know there was any
      hole there, because Jim's counter-pin hung down most to the ground, and
      you'd have to raise it up and look under to see the hole. So we dug
      and dug with the case-knives till most midnight; and then we was
      dog-tired, and our hands was blistered, and yet you couldn't see we'd done
      anything hardly. At last I says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "This ain't no thirty-seven year job; this is a thirty-eight year job, Tom
      Sawyer."
    </p>
   <p>
      He never said nothing. But he sighed, and pretty soon he stopped
      digging, and then for a good little while I knowed that he was thinking.
      Then he says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "It ain't no use, Huck, it ain't a-going to work. If we was
      prisoners it would, because then we'd have as many years as we wanted, and
      no hurry; and we wouldn't get but a few minutes to dig, every day, while
      they was changing watches, and so our hands wouldn't get blistered, and we
      could keep it up right along, year in and year out, and do it right, and
      the way it ought to be done. But <hi rend="italics">we</hi> can't fool along; we got to
      rush; we ain't got no time to spare. If we was to put in another
      night this way we'd have to knock off for a week to let our hands get well—couldn't
      touch a case-knife with them sooner."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Well, then, what we going to do, Tom?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "I'll tell you. It ain't right, and it ain't moral, and I wouldn't
      like it to get out; but there ain't only just the one way: we got to
      dig him out with the picks, and <hi rend="italics">let on</hi> it's case-knives."
    </p>
   <p>
      "<hi rend="italics">Now</hi> you're <hi rend="italics">talking</hi>!" I says; "your head gets leveler and leveler
      all the time, <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom Sawyer</rs>" I says. "Picks is the thing, moral or no
      moral; and as for me, I don't care shucks for the morality of it, nohow.
      When I start in to steal a nigger, or a watermelon, or a
      Sunday-school book, I ain't no ways particular how it's done so it's done.
      What I want is my nigger; or what I want is my watermelon; or what I
      want is my Sunday-school book; and if a pick's the handiest thing, that's
      the thing I'm a-going to dig that nigger or that watermelon or that
      Sunday-school book out with; and I don't give a dead rat what the
      authorities thinks about it nuther."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Well," he says, "there's excuse for picks and letting-on in a case like
      this; if it warn't so, I wouldn't approve of it, nor I wouldn't stand by
      and see the rules broke—because right is right, and wrong is wrong,
      and <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>a body</orig><reg>somebody</reg></choice></distinct> ain't got no business doing wrong when he ain't ignorant and
      knows better. It might answer for <hi rend="italics">you</hi> to dig <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> out with a pick,
      <hi rend="italics">without</hi> any letting on, because you don't know no better; but it wouldn't
      for me, because I do know better. Gimme a case-knife."
    </p>
   <p>
      He had his own by him, but I handed him mine. He flung it down, and
      says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Gimme a <hi rend="italics">case-knife</hi>."
    </p>
   <p>
      I didn't know just what to do—but then I thought. I scratched
      around amongst the old tools, and got a pickaxe and give it to him, and he
      took it and went to work, and never said a word.
    </p>
   <p>
      He was always just that particular. Full of principle.
    </p>
   <p>
      So then I got a shovel, and then we picked and shoveled, turn about, and
      made the fur fly. We stuck to it about a half an hour, which was as
      long as we could stand up; but we had a good deal of a hole to show for
      it. When I got up stairs I looked out at the window and see <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom</rs> oing his
      level best with the lightning-rod, but he couldn't come it, his hands was
      so sore. At last he says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "It ain't no use, it can't be done. What you <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckon</orig><reg>think</reg></choice></distinct> I better do?
      Can't you think of no way?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "Yes," I says, "but I <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckon</orig><reg>think</reg></choice></distinct> it ain't regular. Come up the stairs,
      and let on it's a lightning-rod."
    </p>
   <p>
      So he done it.

   <p>
      Next day <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom</rs> tole a pewter spoon and a brass candlestick in the house,
      for to make some pens for <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> out of, and six tallow candles; and I hung
      around the nigger cabins and laid for a chance, and stole three tin
      plates. <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom</rs> ays it wasn't enough; but I said nobody wouldn't ever
      see the plates that <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> throwed out, because they'd fall in the dog-fennel
      and jimpson weeds under the window-hole—then we could tote them back
      and he could use them over again. So Tom was satisfied. Then
      he says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Now, the thing to study out is, how to get the things to <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs>."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Take them in through the hole," I says, "when we get it done."
    </p>
   <p>
      He only just looked scornful, and said something about nobody ever heard
      of such an idiotic idea, and then he went to studying. By and by he
      said he had ciphered out two or three ways, but there warn't no need to
      decide on any of them yet. Said we'd got to post <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> first.
    </p>
   <p>
      That night we went down the lightning-rod a little after ten, and took one
      of the candles along, and listened under the window-hole, and heard Jim
      snoring; so we pitched it in, and it didn't wake him. Then we
      whirled in with the pick and shovel, and in about two hours and a half the
      job was done. We crept in under Jim's bed and into the cabin, and
      pawed around and found the candle and lit it, and stood over <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> awhile,
      and found him looking hearty and healthy, and then we woke him up gentle
      and gradual. He was so glad to see us he most cried; and called us
      honey, and all the pet names he could think of; and was for having us hunt
      up a cold-chisel to cut the chain off of his leg with right away, and
      clearing out without losing any time. But <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom</rs> e showed him how
      unregular it would be, and set down and told him all about our plans, and
      how we could alter them in a minute any time there was an alarm; and not
      to be the least afraid, because we would see he got away, <hi rend="italics">sure</hi>. So
      Jim he said it was all right, and we set there and talked over old times
      awhile, and then Tom asked a lot of questions, and when Jim told him Uncle
      Silas come in every day or two to pray with him, and Aunt Sally come in to
      see if he was comfortable and had plenty to eat, and both of them was kind
      as they could be, <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom</rs> ays:
    </p>
   <p>
      "<hi rend="italics">Now</hi> I know how to fix it. We'll send you some things by them."
    </p>
   <p>
      I said, "Don't do nothing of the kind; it's one of the most jackass ideas
      I ever struck;" but he never paid no attention to me; went right on.
      It was his way when he'd got his plans set.
    </p>
   <p>
      So he told <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> how we'd have to smuggle in the rope-ladder pie and other
      large things by Nat, the nigger that fed him, and he must be on the
      lookout, and not be surprised, and not let Nat see him open them; and we
      would put small things in uncle's coat-pockets and he must steal them out;
      and we would tie things to aunt's apron-strings or put them in her
      apron-pocket, if we got a chance; and told him what they would be and what
      they was for. And told him how to keep a journal on the shirt with
      his blood, and all that. He told him everything. <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> he couldn't see
      no sense in the most of it, but he allowed we was white folks and knowed
      better than him; so he was satisfied, and said he would do it all just as
      <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom</rs> aid.
    </p>
   <p>
      <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> had plenty corn-cob pipes and tobacco; so we had a right down good
      sociable time; then we crawled out through the hole, and so home to bed,
      with hands that looked like they'd been chawed. Tom was in high
      spirits. He said it was the best fun he ever had in his life, and the most
      intellectural; and said if he only could see his way to it we would keep
      it up all the rest of our lives and leave <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> to our children to get out;
      for he believed <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> would come to like it better and better the more he
      got used to it. He said that in that way it could be strung out to
      as much as eighty year, and would be the best time on record. And he
      said it would make us all celebrated that had a hand in it.
    </p>
   <p>
      In the morning we went out to the woodpile and chopped up the brass
      candlestick into handy sizes, and <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom</rs> ut them and the pewter spoon in his
      pocket. Then we went to the nigger cabins, and while I got Nat's
      notice off, <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom</rs> hoved a piece of candlestick into the middle of a corn-pone
      that was in Jim's pan, and we went along with Nat to see how it would
      work, and it just worked noble; when <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> bit into it it most mashed all
      his teeth out; and there warn't ever anything could a worked better. Tom
      said so himself. <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> he never let on but what it was only just a piece of
      rock or something like that that's always getting into bread, you know;
      but after that he never bit into nothing but what he jabbed his fork into
      it in three or four places first.
    </p>
   <p>
      And whilst we was a-standing there in the dimmish light, here comes a
      couple of the hounds bulging in from under Jim's bed; and they kept on
      piling in till there was eleven of them, and there warn't hardly room in
      there to get your breath. By jings, we forgot to fasten that lean-to
      door! The nigger Nat he only just hollered "Witches" once, and
      keeled over on to the floor amongst the dogs, and begun to groan like he
      was dying. <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom</rs> erked the door open and flung out a slab of Jim's
      meat, and the dogs went for it, and in two seconds he was out himself and
      back again and shut the door, and I knowed he'd fixed the other door too.
      Then he went to work on the nigger, coaxing him and petting him, and
      asking him if he'd been imagining he saw something again. He raised
      up, and blinked his eyes around, and says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Mars Sid, you'll say I's a fool, but if I didn't b'lieve I see most a
      million dogs, er devils, er some'n, I wisht I may die right heah in dese
      tracks. I did, mos' sholy. Mars Sid, I <hi rend="italics">felt</hi> um—I <hi rend="italics">felt</hi>

    </p>
   <p>
      <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom</rs> ays:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Well, I tell you what I think. What makes them come here just at
      this runaway nigger's breakfast-time? It's because they're hungry;
      that's the reason. You make them a witch pie; that's the thing for

      THAT was all fixed. So then we went away and went to the
      rubbage-pile in the back yard, where they keep the old boots, and rags,
      and pieces of bottles, and wore-out tin things, and all such truck, and
      scratched around and found an old tin washpan, and stopped up the holes as
      well as we could, to bake the pie in, and took it down cellar and stole it
      full of flour and started for breakfast, and found a couple of
      shingle-nails that <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom</rs> aid would be handy for a prisoner to scrabble his
      name and sorrows on the dungeon walls with, and dropped one of them in
      Aunt Sally's apron-pocket which was hanging on a chair, and t'other we
      stuck in the band of Uncle Silas's hat, which was on the bureau, because
      we heard the children say their pa and ma was going to the runaway
      nigger's house this morning, and then went to breakfast, and <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom</rs> ropped
      the pewter spoon in Uncle Silas's coat-pocket, and Aunt Sally wasn't come
      yet, so we had to wait a little while.
    </p>
   <p>
      And when she come she was hot and red and cross, and couldn't hardly wait
      for the blessing; and then she went to sluicing out coffee with one hand
      and cracking the handiest child's head with her thimble with the other,
      and says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "I've hunted high and I've hunted low, and it does beat all what <hi rend="italics">has</hi>
      become of your other shirt."
    </p>
   <p>
      My heart fell down amongst my lungs and livers and things, and a hard
      piece of corn-crust started down my throat after it and got met on the
      road with a cough, and was shot across the table, and took one of the
      children in the eye and curled him up like a fishing-worm, and let a cry
      out of him the size of a warwhoop, and <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom</rs> e turned kinder blue around
      the gills, and it all amounted to a considerable state of things for about
      a quarter of a minute or as much as that, and I would a sold out for half
      price if there was a bidder. But after that we was all right again—it
      was the sudden surprise of it that knocked us so kind of cold. Uncle Silas
      he says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "It's most uncommon curious, I can't understand it. I know perfectly
      well I took it <hi rend="italics">off</hi>, because—"
    </p>

      "Because you hain't got but one <hi rend="italics">on</hi>. Just <hi rend="italics">listen</hi> at the man! I
      know you took it off, and know it by a better way than your wool-gethering
      memory, too, because it was on the clo's-line yesterday—I see it
      there myself. But it's gone, that's the long and the short of it, and
      you'll just have to change to a red flann'l one till I can get time to
      make a new one. And it 'll be the third I've made in two years. It
      just keeps <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>a body</orig><reg>somebody</reg></choice></distinct> on the jump to keep you in shirts; and whatever you do
      manage to <hi rend="italics">do</hi> with 'm all is more'n I can make out. <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>A body</orig><reg>Somebody</reg></choice></distinct> 'd think

   <p>
      "I know it, Sally, and I do try all I can. But it oughtn't to be
      altogether my fault, because, you know, I don't see them nor have nothing
      to do with them except when they're on me; and I don't believe I've ever
      lost one of them <hi rend="italics">off</hi> of me."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Well, it ain't <hi rend="italics">your</hi> fault if you haven't, Silas; you'd a done it if you
      could, I <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckon</orig><reg>think</reg></choice></distinct>. And the shirt ain't all that's gone, nuther. Ther's
      a spoon gone; and <hi rend="italics">that</hi> ain't all. There was ten, and now ther's only
      nine. The calf got the shirt, I <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckon</orig><reg>think</reg></choice></distinct>, but the calf never took the spoon,
      <hi rend="italics">that's</hi> certain."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Why, what else is gone, Sally?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "Ther's six <hi rend="italics">candles</hi> gone—that's what. The rats could a got the
      candles, and I <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckon</orig><reg>think</reg></choice></distinct> they did; I wonder they don't walk off with the
      whole place, the way you're always going to stop their holes and don't do
      it; and if they warn't fools they'd sleep in your hair, Silas—<hi rend="italics">you'd</hi>
      never find it out; but you can't lay the <hi rend="italics">spoon</hi> on the rats, and that I
      know."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Well, Sally, I'm in fault, and I acknowledge it; I've been remiss; but I
      won't let to-morrow go by without stopping up them holes."
    </p>

      "Oh, I wouldn't hurry; next year 'll do. Matilda Angelina Araminta

      Whack comes the thimble, and the child snatches her claws out of the

      steps on to the passage, and says:

      "Missus, dey's a sheet gone."

    </p>
   <p>
      "I'll stop up them holes to-day," says Uncle Silas, looking sorrowful.
    </p>
   <p>
      "Oh, <hi rend="italics">do</hi> shet up!—s'pose the rats took the <hi rend="italics">sheet</hi>? <hi rend="italics">where's</hi> it

   <p>
      "I <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckon</orig><reg>think</reg></choice></distinct> the world <hi rend="italics">is</hi> coming to an end. I <hi rend="italics">never</hi> see the beat of it

      "Missus," comes a young yaller wench, "dey's a brass cannelstick miss'n."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Cler out from here, you hussy, er I'll take a skillet to ye!"
    </p>
   <p>
      Well, she was just a-biling. I begun to lay for a chance; I <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckoned</orig><reg>thought</reg></choice></distinct>
      I would sneak out and go for the woods till the weather moderated. She
      kept a-raging right along, running her insurrection all by herself, and
      everybody else mighty meek and quiet; and at last Uncle Silas, looking
      kind of foolish, fishes up that spoon out of his pocket. She
      stopped, with her mouth open and her hands up; and as for me, I wished I
      was in Jeruslem or somewheres. But not long, because she says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "It's <hi rend="italics">just</hi> as I expected. So you had it in your pocket all the time;
      and like as not you've got the other things there, too. How'd it get
      there?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "I reely don't know, Sally," he says, kind of apologizing, "or you know I
      would tell. I was a-studying over my text in Acts Seventeen before
      breakfast, and I <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckon</orig><reg>think</reg></choice></distinct> I put it in there, not noticing, meaning to put my
      Testament in, and it must be so, because my Testament ain't in; but I'll
      go and see; and if the Testament is where I had it, I'll know I didn't put
      it in, and that will show that I laid the Testament down and took up the
      spoon, and—"
    </p>
   <p>
      "Oh, for the land's sake! Give <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>a body</orig><reg>somebody</reg></choice></distinct> a rest! Go 'long now,
      the whole kit and biling of ye; and don't come nigh me again till I've got
      back my peace of mind."
    </p>
   <p>
      I'D a heard her if she'd a said it to herself, let alone speaking it out;
      and I'd a got up and obeyed her if I'd a been dead. As we was
      passing through the setting-room the old man he took up his hat, and the
      shingle-nail fell out on the floor, and he just merely picked it up and
      laid it on the mantel-shelf, and never said nothing, and went out. Tom
      see him do it, and remembered about the spoon, and says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Well, it ain't no use to send things by <hi rend="italics">him</hi> no more, he ain't reliable."
      Then he says: "But he done us a good turn with the spoon, anyway,
      without knowing it, and so we'll go and do him one without <hi rend="italics">him</hi> knowing it—stop
      up his rat-holes."
    </p>
   <p>
      There was a noble good lot of them down cellar, and it took us a whole
      hour, but we done the job tight and good and shipshape. Then we
      heard steps on the stairs, and blowed out our light and hid; and here
      comes the old man, with a candle in one hand and a bundle of stuff in
      t'other, looking as absent-minded as year before last. He went a
      mooning around, first to one rat-hole and then another, till he'd been to
      them all. Then he stood about five minutes, picking tallow-drip off
      of his candle and thinking. Then he turns off slow and dreamy
      towards the stairs, saying:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Well, for the life of me I can't remember when I done it. I could
      show her now that I warn't to blame on account of the rats. But
      never mind—let it go. I <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckon</orig><reg>think</reg></choice></distinct> it wouldn't do no good."
    </p>
   <p>
      And so he went on a-mumbling up stairs, and then we left. He was a
      mighty nice old man. And always is.
    </p>
   <p>
      Tom was a good deal bothered about what to do for a spoon, but he said
      we'd got to have it; so he took a think. When he had ciphered it out
      he told me how we was to do; then we went and waited around the
      spoon-basket till we see Aunt Sally coming, and then Tom went to counting
      the spoons and laying them out to one side, and I slid one of them up my
      sleeve, and <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom</rs> ays:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Why, Aunt Sally, there ain't but nine spoons <hi rend="italics">yet</hi>."
    </p>
   <p>
      She says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Go 'long to your play, and don't bother me. I know better, I
      counted 'm myself."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Well, I've counted them twice, Aunty, and I can't make but nine."
    </p>
   <p>
      She looked out of all patience, but of course she come to count—anybody
      would.
    </p>
   <p>
      "I declare to gracious ther' <hi rend="italics">ain't</hi> but nine!" she says. "Why, what
      in the world—plague <hi rend="italics">take</hi> the things, I'll count 'm again."
    </p>
   <p>
      So I slipped back the one I had, and when she got done counting, she says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Hang the troublesome rubbage, ther's <hi rend="italics">ten</hi> now!" and she looked huffy and
      bothered both. But <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom</rs> ays:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Why, Aunty, I don't think there's ten."
    </p>
   <p>
      "You numskull, didn't you see me <hi rend="italics">count 'm?</hi>"
    </p>
   <p>
      "I know, but—"
    </p>
   <p>
      "Well, I'll count 'm <hi rend="italics">again</hi>."
    </p>
   <p>

    </p>
   <p>
      So I smouched one, and they come out nine, same as the other time. Well,
      she <hi rend="italics">was</hi> in a tearing way—just a-trembling all over, she was so mad.
      But she counted and counted till she got that addled she'd start to
      count in the basket for a spoon sometimes; and so, three times they come
      out right, and three times they come out wrong. Then she grabbed up
      the basket and slammed it across the house and knocked the cat
      galley-west; and she said cle'r out and let her have some peace, and if we
      come bothering around her again betwixt that and dinner she'd skin us.
      So we had the odd spoon, and dropped it in her apron-pocket whilst
      she was a-giving us our sailing orders, and <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> got it all right, along
      with her shingle nail, before noon. We was very well satisfied with
      this business, and Tom allowed it was worth twice the trouble it took,
      because he said <hi rend="italics">now</hi> she couldn't ever count them spoons twice alike again
      to save her life; and wouldn't believe she'd counted them right if she
      <hi rend="italics">did</hi>; and said that after she'd about counted her head off for the next
      three days he judged she'd give it up and offer to kill anybody that
      wanted her to ever count them any more.
    </p>
   <p>
      So we put the sheet back on the line that night, and stole one out of her
      closet; and kept on putting it back and stealing it again for a couple of
      days till she didn't know how many sheets she had any more, and she didn't
      <hi rend="italics">care</hi>, and warn't a-going to bullyrag the rest of her soul out about it,
      and wouldn't count them again not to save her life; she druther die first.
    </p>
   <p>
      So we was all right now, as to the shirt and the sheet and the spoon and
      the candles, by the help of the calf and the rats and the mixed-up
      counting; and as to the candlestick, it warn't no consequence, it would
      blow over by and by.
    </p>
   <p>
      But that pie was a job; we had no end of trouble with that pie. We
      fixed it up away down in the woods, and cooked it there; and we got it
      done at last, and very satisfactory, too; but not all in one day; and we
      had to use up three wash-pans full of flour before we got through, and we
      got burnt pretty much all over, in places, and eyes put out with the
      smoke; because, you see, we didn't want nothing but a crust, and we
      couldn't prop it up right, and she would always cave in. But of
      course we thought of the right way at last—which was to cook the
      ladder, too, in the pie. So then we laid in with <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> the second
      night, and tore up the sheet all in little strings and twisted them
      together, and long before daylight we had a lovely rope that you could a
      hung a person with. We let on it took nine months to make it.
    </p>
   <p>
      And in the forenoon we took it down to the woods, but it wouldn't go into
      the pie. Being made of a whole sheet, that way, there was rope
      enough for forty pies if we'd a wanted them, and plenty left over for
      soup, or sausage, or anything you choose. We could a had a whole
      dinner.
    </p>
   <p>
        
    </p>

   <p>
       <lb/>
    </p>
   <p>
      But we didn't need it. All we needed was just enough for the pie,
      and so we throwed the rest away. We didn't cook none of the pies in
      the wash-pan—afraid the solder would melt; but Uncle Silas he had a
      noble brass warming-pan which he thought considerable of, because it
      belonged to one of his ancesters with a long wooden handle that come over
      from England with William the Conqueror in the Mayflower or one of them
      early ships and was hid away up garret with a lot of other old pots and
      things that was valuable, not on account of being any account, because
      they warn't, but on account of them being relicts, you know, and we snaked
      her out, private, and took her down there, but she failed on the first
      pies, because we didn't know how, but she come up smiling on the last one.
      We took and lined her with dough, and set her in the coals, and
      loaded her up with rag rope, and put on a dough roof, and shut down the
      lid, and put hot embers on top, and stood off five foot, with the long
      handle, cool and comfortable, and in fifteen minutes she turned out a pie
      that was a satisfaction to look at. But the person that et it would want
      to fetch a couple of kags of toothpicks along, for if that rope ladder
      wouldn't cramp him down to business I don't know nothing what I'm talking
      about, and lay him in enough stomach-ache to last him till next time, too.
    </p>
   <p>
      Nat didn't look when we put the witch pie in Jim's pan; and we put the
      three tin plates in the bottom of the pan under the vittles; and so Jim
      got everything all right, and as soon as he was by himself he busted into
      the pie and hid the rope ladder inside of his straw tick, and scratched
      some marks on a tin plate and throwed it out of the window-hole.

      MAKING them pens was a distressid tough job, and so was the saw; and Jim
      allowed the inscription was going to be the toughest of all. That's
      the one which the prisoner has to scrabble on the wall. But he had
      to have it; <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom</rs> aid he'd <hi rend="italics">got</hi> to; there warn't no case of a state prisoner
      not scrabbling his inscription to leave behind, and his coat of arms.
    </p>
   <p>
      "Look at Lady Jane Grey," he says; "look at Gilford Dudley; look at old
      Northumberland! Why, Huck, s'pose it <hi rend="italics">is</hi> considerble trouble?—what
      you going to do?—how you going to get around it? Jim's <hi rend="italics">got</hi> to
      do his inscription and coat of arms. They all do."
    </p>
   <p>
      <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Why, Mars Tom, I hain't got no coat o' arm; I hain't got nuffn but dish
      yer ole shirt, en you knows I got to keep de journal on dat."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Oh, you don't understand, Jim; a coat of arms is very different."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Well," I says, "Jim's right, anyway, when he says he ain't got no coat of
      arms, because he hain't."
    </p>
   <p>
      "I <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckon</orig><reg>think</reg></choice></distinct> I knowed that," <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom</rs> ays, "but you bet he'll have one before he
      goes out of this—because he's going out <hi rend="italics">right</hi>, and there ain't going
      to be no flaws in his record."
    </p>
   <p>
      So whilst me and <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> filed away at the pens on a brickbat apiece, <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> a-making
his'n out of the brass and I making mine out of the spoon, <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom</rs> et
      to work to think out the coat of arms. By and by he said he'd struck
      so many good ones he didn't hardly know which to take, but there was one
      which he <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckoned</orig><reg>thought</reg></choice></distinct> he'd decide on. He says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "On the scutcheon we'll have a bend <hi rend="italics">or</hi> in the dexter base, a saltire
      <hi rend="italics">murrey</hi> in the fess, with a dog, couchant, for common charge, and under his
      foot a chain embattled, for slavery, with a chevron <hi rend="italics">vert</hi> in a chief
      engrailed, and three invected lines on a field <hi rend="italics">azure</hi>, with the nombril
      points rampant on a dancette indented; crest, a runaway nigger, <hi rend="italics">sable</hi>,
      with his bundle over his shoulder on a bar sinister; and a couple of gules
      for supporters, which is you and me; motto, <hi rend="italics">Maggiore Fretta, Minore Otto.</hi>
      Got it out of a book—means the more haste the less speed."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Geewhillikins," I says, "but what does the rest of it mean?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "We ain't got no time to bother over that," he says; "we got to dig in
      like all git-out."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Well, anyway," I says, "what's <hi rend="italics">some</hi> of it? What's a fess?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "A fess—a fess is—<hi rend="italics">you</hi> don't need to know what a fess is.
      I'll show him how to make it when he gets to it."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Shucks, Tom," I says, "I think you might tell a person. What's a
      bar sinister?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "Oh, I don't know. But he's got to have it. All the nobility
      does."
    </p>
   <p>
      That was just his way. If it didn't suit him to explain a thing to
      you, he wouldn't do it. You might pump at him a week, it wouldn't
      make no difference.
    </p>
   <p>
      He'd got all that coat of arms business fixed, so now he started in to
      finish up the rest of that part of the work, which was to plan out a
      mournful inscription—said <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> got to have one, like they all done.
      He made up a lot, and wrote them out on a paper, and read them off,
      so:
    </p>
   <p>
      1. Here a captive heart busted. 2. Here a poor prisoner,
      forsook by the world and friends, fretted his sorrowful life. 3. Here
      a lonely heart broke, and a worn spirit went to its rest, after
      thirty-seven years of solitary captivity. 4. Here, homeless and
      friendless, after thirty-seven years of bitter captivity, perished a noble
      stranger, natural son of Louis XIV.
    </p>
   <p>
      Tom's voice trembled whilst he was reading them, and he most broke down.
      When he got done he couldn't no way make up his mind which one for <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> to
      scrabble on to the wall, they was all so good; but at last he allowed he
      would let him scrabble them all on. <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> said it would take him a
      year to scrabble such a lot of truck on to the logs with a nail, and he
      didn't know how to make letters, besides; but <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom</rs> aid he would block them
      out for him, and then he wouldn't have nothing to do but just follow the
      lines. Then pretty soon he says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Come to think, the logs ain't a-going to do; they don't have log walls in
      a dungeon: we got to dig the inscriptions into a rock. We'll
      fetch a rock."
    </p>
   <p>
      <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> said the rock was worse than the logs; he said it would take him such
      a pison long time to dig them into a rock he wouldn't ever get out. But
      <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom</rs> aid he would let me help him do it. Then he took a look to see
      how me and <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> was getting along with the pens. It was most pesky
      tedious hard work and slow, and didn't give my hands no show to get well
      of the sores, and we didn't seem to make no headway, hardly; so <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom</rs> ays:
    </p>
   <p>
      "I know how to fix it. We got to have a rock for the coat of arms
      and mournful inscriptions, and we can kill two birds with that same rock.
      There's a gaudy big grindstone down at the mill, and we'll smouch it, and
      carve the things on it, and file out the pens and the saw on it, too."

   <p>
      It warn't no slouch of an idea; and it warn't no slouch of a grindstone
      nuther; but we allowed we'd tackle it. It warn't quite midnight yet,
      so we cleared out for the mill, leaving <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> at work. We smouched the
      grindstone, and set out to roll her home, but it was a most nation tough
      job. Sometimes, do what we could, we couldn't keep her from falling over,
      and she come mighty near mashing us every time. <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom</rs> aid she was
      going to get one of us, sure, before we got through. We got her half
      way; and then we was plumb played out, and most drownded with sweat.
      We see it warn't no use; we got to go and fetch <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs>. So he raised up
      his bed and slid the chain off of the bed-leg, and wrapt it round and
      round his neck, and we crawled out through our hole and down there, and
      <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> and me laid into that grindstone and walked her along like nothing;
      and <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom</rs> uperintended. He could out-superintend any boy I ever see.
      He knowed how to do everything.
    </p>
   <p>
      Our hole was pretty big, but it warn't big enough to get the grindstone
      through; but <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> he took the pick and soon made it big enough. Then
      <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom</rs> arked out them things on it with the nail, and set <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> to work on
      them, with the nail for a chisel and an iron bolt from the rubbage in the
      lean-to for a hammer, and told him to work till the rest of his candle
      quit on him, and then he could go to bed, and hide the grindstone under
      his straw tick and sleep on it. Then we helped him fix his chain
      back on the bed-leg, and was ready for bed ourselves. But Tom
      thought of something, and says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "You got any spiders in here, Jim?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "No, sah, thanks to goodness I hain't, Mars Tom."
    </p>
   <p>
      "All right, we'll get you some."
    </p>
   <p>
      "But bless you, honey, I doan' <hi rend="italics">want</hi> none. I's afeard un um. I
      jis' 's soon have rattlesnakes aroun'."
    </p>
   <p>
      <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom</rs> hought a minute or two, and says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "It's a good idea. And I <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckon</orig><reg>think</reg></choice></distinct> it's been done. It <hi rend="italics">must</hi> a been
      done; it stands to reason. Yes, it's a prime good idea. Where
      could you keep it?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "Keep what, Mars Tom?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "Why, a rattlesnake."
    </p>
   <p>
      "De goodness gracious alive, Mars Tom! Why, if dey was a rattlesnake
      to come in heah I'd take en bust right out thoo dat log wall, I would, wid
      my head."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Why, Jim, you wouldn't be afraid of it after a little. You could
      tame it."
    </p>
   <p>
      "<hi rend="italics">Tame</hi> it!"
    </p>
   <p>
      "Yes—easy enough. Every animal is grateful for kindness and
      petting, and they wouldn't <hi rend="italics">think</hi> of hurting a person that pets them.
      Any book will tell you that. You try—that's all I ask;
      just try for two or three days. Why, you can get him so, in a little
      while, that he'll love you; and sleep with you; and won't stay away from
      you a minute; and will let you wrap him round your neck and put his head
      in your mouth."
    </p>
   <p>
      "<hi rend="italics">Please</hi>, Mars Tom—<hi rend="italics">doan</hi>' talk so! I can't <hi rend="italics">stan</hi>' it! He'd
      <hi rend="italics">let</hi> me shove his head in my mouf—fer a favor, hain't it? I lay

      <hi rend="italics">want</hi> him to sleep wid me."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Jim, don't act so foolish. A prisoner's <hi rend="italics">got</hi> to have some kind of a
      dumb pet, and if a rattlesnake hain't ever been tried, why, there's more
      glory to be gained in your being the first to ever try it than any other
      way you could ever think of to save your life."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Why, Mars Tom, I doan' <hi rend="italics">want</hi> no sich glory. Snake take 'n bite Jim's
      chin off, den <hi rend="italics">whah</hi> is de glory? No, sah, I doan' want no sich

    </p>
   <p>
      "Blame it, can't you <hi rend="italics">try</hi>? I only <hi rend="italics">want</hi> you to try—you needn't
      keep it up if it don't work."
    </p>
   <p>
      "But de trouble all <hi rend="italics">done</hi> ef de snake bite me while I's a tryin' him. Mars

    </p>
   <p>
      "Well, then, let it go, let it go, if you're so bull-headed about it.
      We can get you some garter-snakes, and you can tie some buttons on
      their tails, and let on they're rattlesnakes, and I <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckon</orig><reg>think</reg></choice></distinct> that 'll have

      "I k'n stan' <hi rend="italics">dem</hi>, Mars Tom, but blame' 'f I couldn' get along widout um, I
      tell you dat. I never knowed b'fo' 't was so much bother and trouble
      to be a prisoner."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Well, it <hi rend="italics">always</hi> is when it's done right. You got any rats around
      here?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "No, sah, I hain't seed none."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Well, we'll get you some rats."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Why, Mars Tom, I doan' <hi rend="italics">want</hi> no rats. Dey's de dadblamedest creturs

      skasely."
    </p>
   <p>
      "But, Jim, you <hi rend="italics">got</hi> to have 'em—they all do. So don't make no
      more fuss about it. Prisoners ain't ever without rats. There
      ain't no instance of it. And they train them, and pet them, and
      learn them tricks, and they get to be as sociable as flies. But you
      got to play music to them. You got anything to play music on?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "I ain' got nuffn but a coase comb en a piece o' paper, en a juice-harp;
      but I reck'n dey wouldn' take no stock in a juice-harp."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Yes they would<hi rend="italics">they</hi> don't care what kind of music 'tis. A
      jews-harp's plenty good enough for a rat. All animals like music—in
      a prison they dote on it. Specially, painful music; and you can't
      get no other kind out of a jews-harp. It always interests them; they
      come out to see what's the matter with you. Yes, you're all right;
      you're fixed very well. You want to set on your bed nights before
      you go to sleep, and early in the mornings, and play your jews-harp; play
      'The Last Link is Broken'—that's the thing that 'll scoop a rat
      quicker 'n anything else; and when you've played about two minutes you'll
      see all the rats, and the snakes, and spiders, and things begin to feel
      worried about you, and come. And they'll just fairly swarm over you,
      and have a noble good time."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Yes, <hi rend="italics">dey</hi> will, I reck'n, Mars Tom, but what kine er time is <hi rend="italics">Jim</hi> havin'?
      Blest if I kin see de pint. But I'll do it ef I got to. I
      reck'n I better keep de animals satisfied, en not have no trouble in de
      house."
    </p>
   <p>
      Tom waited to think it over, and see if there wasn't nothing else; and
      pretty soon he says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Oh, there's one thing I forgot. Could you raise a flower here, do
      you <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckon</orig><reg>think</reg></choice></distinct>?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "I doan know but maybe I could, Mars Tom; but it's tolable dark in heah,
      en I ain' got no use f'r no flower, nohow, en she'd be a pow'ful sight o'
      trouble."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Well, you try it, anyway. Some other prisoners has done it."
    </p>
   <p>
      "One er dem big cat-tail-lookin' mullen-stalks would grow in heah, Mars
      Tom, I reck'n, but she wouldn't be wuth half de trouble she'd coss."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Don't you believe it. We'll fetch you a little one and you plant it
      in the corner over there, and raise it. And don't call it mullen,
      call it Pitchiola—that's its right name when it's in a prison.
      And you want to water it with your tears."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Why, I got plenty spring water, Mars Tom."
    </p>
   <p>
      "You don't <hi rend="italics">want</hi> spring water; you want to water it with your tears. It's
      the way they always do."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Why, Mars Tom, I lay I kin raise one er dem mullen-stalks twyste wid
      spring water whiles another man's a <hi rend="italics">start'n</hi> one wid tears."

      "That ain't the idea. You <hi rend="italics">got</hi> to do it with tears."
    </p>
   <p>
      "She'll die on my han's, Mars Tom, she sholy will; kase I doan' skasely

    </p>
   <p>
      So Tom was stumped. But he studied it over, and then said <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> would
      have to worry along the best he could with an onion. He promised he
      would go to the nigger cabins and drop one, private, in Jim's coffee-pot,
      in the morning. <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> said he would "jis' 's soon have tobacker in his
      coffee;" and found so much fault with it, and with the work and bother of
      raising the mullen, and jews-harping the rats, and petting and flattering
      up the snakes and spiders and things, on top of all the other work he had
      to do on pens, and inscriptions, and journals, and things, which made it
      more trouble and worry and responsibility to be a prisoner than anything
      he ever undertook, that <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom</rs> ost lost all patience with him; and said he
      was just loadened down with more gaudier chances than a prisoner ever had
      in the world to make a name for himself, and yet he didn't know enough to
      appreciate them, and they was just about wasted on him. So <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> he
      was sorry, and said he wouldn't behave so no more, and then me and Tom
      shoved for bed.

   <p>
      IN the morning we went up to the village and bought a wire rat-trap and
      fetched it down, and unstopped the best rat-hole, and in about an hour we
      had fifteen of the bulliest kind of ones; and then we took it and put it
      in a safe place under Aunt Sally's bed. But while we was gone for
      spiders little Thomas Franklin Benjamin Jefferson Elexander Phelps found
      it there, and opened the door of it to see if the rats would come out, and
      they did; and Aunt Sally she come in, and when we got back she was
      a-standing on top of the bed raising Cain, and the rats was doing what
      they could to keep off the dull times for her. So she took and
      dusted us both with the hickry, and we was as much as two hours catching
      another fifteen or sixteen, drat that meddlesome cub, and they warn't the
      likeliest, nuther, because the first haul was the pick of the flock.
      I never see a likelier lot of rats than what that first haul was.
    </p>
   <p>
      We got a splendid stock of sorted spiders, and bugs, and frogs, and
      caterpillars, and one thing or another; and we like to got a hornet's
      nest, but we didn't. The family was at home. We didn't give it
      right up, but stayed with them as long as we could; because we allowed
      we'd tire them out or they'd got to tire us out, and they done it. Then
      we got allycumpain and rubbed on the places, and was pretty near all right
      again, but couldn't set down convenient. And so we went for the
      snakes, and grabbed a couple of dozen garters and house-snakes, and put
      them in a bag, and put it in our room, and by that time it was
      supper-time, and a rattling good honest day's work: and hungry?—oh,
      no, I <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckon</orig><reg>think</reg></choice></distinct> not! And there warn't a blessed snake up there when we
      went back—we didn't half tie the sack, and they worked out somehow,
      and left. But it didn't matter much, because they was still on the
      premises somewheres. So we judged we could get some of them again.
      No, there warn't no real scarcity of snakes about the house for a
      considerable spell. You'd see them dripping from the rafters and
      places every now and then; and they generly landed in your plate, or down
      the back of your neck, and most of the time where you didn't want them.
      Well, they was handsome and striped, and there warn't no harm in a
      million of them; but that never made no difference to Aunt Sally; she
      despised snakes, be the breed what they might, and she couldn't stand them
      no way you could fix it; and every time one of them flopped down on her,
      it didn't make no difference what she was doing, she would just lay that
      work down and light out. I never see such a woman. And you
      could hear her whoop to Jericho. You couldn't get her to take a-holt
      of one of them with the tongs. And if she turned over and found one
      in bed she would scramble out and lift a howl that you would think the
      house was afire. She disturbed the old man so that he said he could
      most wish there hadn't ever been no snakes created. Why, after every
      last snake had been gone clear out of the house for as much as a week Aunt
      Sally warn't over it yet; she warn't near over it; when she was setting
      thinking about something you could touch her on the back of her neck with
      a feather and she would jump right out of her stockings. It was very
      curious. But <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom</rs> aid all women was just so. He said they was
      made that way for some reason or other.
    </p>
   <p>
      We got a licking every time one of our snakes come in her way, and she
      allowed these lickings warn't nothing to what she would do if we ever
      loaded up the place again with them. I didn't mind the lickings,
      because they didn't amount to nothing; but I minded the trouble we had to
      lay in another lot. But we got them laid in, and all the other
      things; and you never see a cabin as blithesome as Jim's was when they'd
      all swarm out for music and go for him. <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> didn't like the spiders,
      and the spiders didn't like Jim; and so they'd lay for him, and make it
      mighty warm for him. And he said that between the rats and the
      snakes and the grindstone there warn't no room in bed for him, skasely;
      and when there was, <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>a body</orig><reg>somebody</reg></choice></distinct> couldn't sleep, it was so lively, and it was
      always lively, he said, because <hi rend="italics">they</hi> never all slept at one time, but took
      turn about, so when the snakes was asleep the rats was on deck, and when
      the rats turned in the snakes come on watch, so he always had one gang
      under him, in his way, and t'other gang having a circus over him, and if
      he got up to hunt a new place the spiders would take a chance at him as he
      crossed over. He said if he ever got out this time he wouldn't ever be a
      prisoner again, not for a salary.
    </p>
   <p>
      Well, by the end of three weeks everything was in pretty good shape.
      The shirt was sent in early, in a pie, and every time a rat bit Jim
      he would get up and write a little in his journal whilst the ink was
      fresh; the pens was made, the inscriptions and so on was all carved on the
      grindstone; the bed-leg was sawed in two, and we had et up the sawdust,
      and it give us a most amazing stomach-ache. We <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckoned</orig><reg>thought</reg></choice></distinct> we was all
      going to die, but didn't. It was the most undigestible sawdust I
      ever see; and <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom</rs> aid the same.

   <p>
      But as I was saying, we'd got all the work done now, at last; and we was
      all pretty much fagged out, too, but mainly <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs>. The old man had
      wrote a couple of times to the plantation below Orleans to come and get
      their runaway nigger, but hadn't got no answer, because there warn't no
      such plantation; so he allowed he would advertise <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> in the St. Louis and
      New Orleans papers; and when he mentioned the St. Louis ones it give me
      the cold shivers, and I see we hadn't no time to lose. So <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom</rs> aid, now
      for the nonnamous letters.
    </p>
   <p>
      "What's them?" I says.
    </p>
   <p>
      "Warnings to the people that something is up. Sometimes it's done
      one way, sometimes another. But there's always somebody spying
      around that gives notice to the governor of the castle. When Louis
      XVI. was going to light out of the Tooleries, a servant-girl done it.
      It's a very good way, and so is the nonnamous letters. We'll
      use them both. And it's usual for the prisoner's mother to change
      clothes with him, and she stays in, and he slides out in her clothes.
      We'll do that, too."
    </p>
   <p>
      "But looky here, Tom, what do we want to <hi rend="italics">warn</hi> anybody for that something's
      up? Let them find it out for themselves—it's their lookout."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Yes, I know; but you can't depend on them. It's the way they've
      acted from the very start—left us to do <hi rend="italics">everything</hi>. They're so
      confiding and mullet-headed they don't take notice of nothing at all.
      So if we don't <hi rend="italics">give</hi> them notice there won't be nobody nor nothing to
      interfere with us, and so after all our hard work and trouble this escape
      'll go off perfectly flat; won't amount to nothing—won't be nothing
      <hi rend="italics">to</hi> it."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Well, as for me, Tom, that's the way I'd like."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Shucks!" he says, and looked disgusted. So I says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "But I ain't going to make no complaint. Any way that suits you
      suits me. What you going to do about the servant-girl?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "You'll be her. You slide in, in the middle of the night, and hook
      that yaller girl's frock."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Why, Tom, that 'll make trouble next morning; because, of course, she
      prob'bly hain't got any but that one."
    </p>
   <p>
      "I know; but you don't want it but fifteen minutes, to carry the nonnamous
      letter and shove it under the front door."
    </p>
   <p>
      "All right, then, I'll do it; but I could carry it just as handy in my own
      togs."
    </p>
   <p>
      "You wouldn't look like a servant-girl <hi rend="italics">then</hi>, would you?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "No, but there won't be nobody to see what I look like, <hi rend="italics">anyway</hi>."
    </p>
   <p>
      "That ain't got nothing to do with it. The thing for us to do is
      just to do our <hi rend="italics">duty</hi>, and not worry about whether anybody <hi rend="italics">sees</hi> us do it or
      not. Hain't you got no principle at all?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "All right, I ain't saying nothing; I'm the servant-girl. Who's
      Jim's mother?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "I'm his mother. I'll hook a gown from Aunt Sally."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Well, then, you'll have to stay in the cabin when me and <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> leaves."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Not much. I'll stuff Jim's clothes full of straw and lay it on his
      bed to represent his mother in disguise, and <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> 'll take the nigger
      woman's gown off of me and wear it, and we'll all evade together. When
      a prisoner of style escapes it's called an evasion. It's always
      called so when a king escapes, f'rinstance. And the same with a
      king's son; it don't make no difference whether he's a natural one or an
      unnatural one."
    </p>
   <p>
      So <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom</rs> e wrote the nonnamous letter, and I smouched the yaller wench's
      frock that night, and put it on, and shoved it under the front door, the
      way <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom</rs> old me to. It said:
    </p>
   <p>
      Beware. Trouble is brewing. Keep a sharp lookout. <hi rend="italics">Unknown</hi>
      <hi rend="italics">Friend</hi>.

   <p>
      Next night we stuck a picture, which <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom</rs> rawed in blood, of a skull and
      crossbones on the front door; and next night another one of a coffin on
      the back door. I never see a family in such a sweat. They
      couldn't a been worse scared if the place had a been full of ghosts laying
      for them behind everything and under the beds and shivering through the
      air. If a door banged, Aunt Sally she jumped and said "ouch!" if
      anything fell, she jumped and said "ouch!" if you happened to touch her,
      when she warn't noticing, she done the same; she couldn't face noway and
      be satisfied, because she allowed there was something behind her every
      time—so she was always a-whirling around sudden, and saying "ouch,"
      and before she'd got two-thirds around she'd whirl back again, and say it
      again; and she was afraid to go to bed, but she dasn't set up. So
      the thing was working very well, <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom</rs> aid; he said he never see a thing
      work more satisfactory. He said it showed it was done right.
    </p>
   <p>
      So he said, now for the grand bulge! So the very next morning at the
      streak of dawn we got another letter ready, and was wondering what we
      better do with it, because we heard them say at supper they was going to
      have a nigger on watch at both doors all night. <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom</rs> e went down the
      lightning-rod to spy around; and the nigger at the back door was asleep,
      and he stuck it in the back of his neck and come back. This letter
      said:
    </p>
   <p>
      Don't betray me, I wish to be your friend. There is a desprate gang
      of cutthroats from over in the Indian Territory going to steal your
      runaway nigger to-night, and they have been trying to scare you so as you
      will stay in the house and not bother them. I am one of the gang,
      but have got religgion and wish to quit it and lead an honest life again,
      and will betray the helish design. They will sneak down from northards,
      along the fence, at midnight exact, with a false key, and go in the
      nigger's cabin to get him. I am to be off a piece and blow a tin horn if I
      see any danger; but stead of that I will <hi rend="italics">baa</hi> like a sheep soon as they get
      in and not blow at all; then whilst they are getting his chains loose, you
      slip there and lock them in, and can kill them at your leasure. Don't
      do anything but just the way I am telling you, if you do they will
      suspicion something and raise whoop-jamboreehoo. I do not wish any reward
      but to know I have done the right thing. <hi rend="italics">Unknown Friend.</hi>

   <p>
      WE was feeling pretty good after breakfast, and took my canoe and went
      over the river a-fishing, with a lunch, and had a good time, and took a
      look at the raft and found her all right, and got home late to supper, and
      found them in such a sweat and worry they didn't know which end they was
      standing on, and made us go right off to bed the minute we was done
      supper, and wouldn't tell us what the trouble was, and never let on a word
      about the new letter, but didn't need to, because we knowed as much about
      it as anybody did, and as soon as we was half up stairs and her back was
      turned we slid for the cellar cupboard and loaded up a good lunch and took
      it up to our room and went to bed, and got up about half-past eleven, and
      <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom</rs> ut on Aunt Sally's dress that he stole and was going to start with
      the lunch, but says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Where's the butter?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "I laid out a hunk of it," I says, "on a piece of a corn-pone."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Well, you <hi rend="italics">left</hi> it laid out, then—it ain't here."
    </p>
   <p>
      "We can get along without it," I says.
    </p>
   <p>
      "We can get along <hi rend="italics">with</hi> it, too," he says; "just you slide down cellar and
      fetch it. And then mosey right down the lightning-rod and come
      along. I'll go and stuff the straw into Jim's clothes to represent his
      mother in disguise, and be ready to <hi rend="italics">baa</hi> like a sheep and shove soon as you
      get there."
    </p>
   <p>
      So out he went, and down cellar went I. The hunk of butter, big as a
      person's fist, was where I had left it, so I took up the slab of corn-pone
      with it on, and blowed out my light, and started up stairs very
      stealthy, and got up to the main floor all right, but here comes Aunt
      Sally with a candle, and I clapped the truck in my hat, and clapped my hat
      on my head, and the next second she see me; and she says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "You been down cellar?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "Yes'm."
    </p>
   <p>
      "What you been doing down there?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "Noth'n."
    </p>
   <p>
      "<hi rend="italics">Noth'n!</hi>"
    </p>
   <p>
      "No'm."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Well, then, what possessed you to go down there this time of night?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "I don't know 'm."
    </p>
   <p>
      "You don't <hi rend="italics">know</hi>? Don't answer me that way. Tom, I want to know what
      you been <hi rend="italics">doing</hi> down there."
    </p>
   <p>
      "I hain't been doing a single thing, Aunt Sally, I hope to gracious if I
      have."
    </p>
   <p>
      I <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckoned</orig><reg>thought</reg></choice></distinct> she'd let me go now, and as a generl thing she would; but I
      s'pose there was so many strange things going on she was just in a sweat
      about every little thing that warn't yard-stick straight; so she says,
      very decided:
    </p>
   <p>
      "You just march into that setting-room and stay there till I come. You
      been up to something you no business to, and I lay I'll find out what it
      is before I'M done with you."
    </p>
   <p>
      So she went away as I opened the door and walked into the setting-room.
      My, but there was a crowd there! Fifteen farmers, and every one of
      them had a gun. I was most powerful sick, and slunk to a chair and
      set down. They was setting around, some of them talking a little, in a low
      voice, and all of them fidgety and uneasy, but trying to look like they
      warn't; but I knowed they was, because they was always taking off their
      hats, and putting them on, and scratching their heads, and changing their
      seats, and fumbling with their buttons. I warn't easy myself, but I
      didn't take my hat off, all the same.
    </p>

    </p>
   <p>
      I did wish Aunt Sally would come, and get done with me, and lick me, if
      she wanted to, and let me get away and tell <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom</rs> ow we'd overdone this
      thing, and what a thundering hornet's-nest we'd got ourselves into, so we
      could stop fooling around straight off, and clear out with <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> before
      these rips got out of patience and come for us.
    </p>
   <p>
      At last she come and begun to ask me questions, but I <hi rend="italics">couldn't</hi> answer them
      straight, I didn't know which end of me was up; because these men was in
      such a fidget now that some was wanting to start right NOW and lay for
      them desperadoes, and saying it warn't but a few minutes to midnight; and
      others was trying to get them to hold on and wait for the sheep-signal;
      and here was Aunty pegging away at the questions, and me a-shaking all
      over and ready to sink down in my tracks I was that scared; and the place
      getting hotter and hotter, and the butter beginning to melt and run down
      my neck and behind my ears; and pretty soon, when one of them says, "I'M
      for going and getting in the cabin <hi rend="italics">first</hi> and right <hi rend="italics">now</hi>, and catching them
      when they come," I most dropped; and a streak of butter come a-trickling
      down my forehead, and Aunt Sally she see it, and turns white as a sheet,
      and says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "For the land's sake, what <hi rend="italics">is</hi> the matter with the child? He's got
      the brain-fever as shore as you're born, and they're oozing out!"
    </p>
   <p>
      And everybody runs to see, and she snatches off my hat, and out comes the
      bread and what was left of the butter, and she grabbed me, and hugged me,
      and says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Oh, what a turn you did give me! and how glad and grateful I am it ain't
      no worse; for luck's against us, and it never rains but it pours, and when
      I see that truck I thought we'd lost you, for I knowed by the color and
      all it was just like your brains would be if—Dear, dear, whyd'nt you
      <hi rend="italics">tell</hi> me that was what you'd been down there for, I wouldn't a cared.
      Now cler out to bed, and don't lemme see no more of you till
      morning!"
    </p>
   <p>
      I was up stairs in a second, and down the lightning-rod in another one,
      and shinning through the dark for the lean-to. I couldn't hardly get
      my words out, I was so anxious; but I told Tom as quick as I could we must
      jump for it now, and not a minute to lose—the house full of men,
      yonder, with guns!
    </p>
   <p>
      His eyes just blazed; and he says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "No!—is that so? <hi rend="italics">ain't</hi> it bully! Why, Huck, if it was to
      do over again, I bet I could fetch two hundred! If we could put it
      off till—"
    </p>
   <p>
      "Hurry! <hi rend="italics">Hurry</hi>!" I says. "Where's Jim?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "Right at your elbow; if you reach out your arm you can touch him. He's
      dressed, and everything's ready. Now we'll slide out and give the
      sheep-signal."
    </p>
   <p>
      But then we heard the tramp of men coming to the door, and heard them
      begin to fumble with the pad-lock, and heard a man say:
    </p>
   <p>
      "I <hi rend="italics">told</hi> you we'd be too soon; they haven't come—the door is locked.
      Here, I'll lock some of you into the cabin, and you lay for 'em in the
      dark and kill 'em when they come; and the rest scatter around a piece, and
      listen if you can hear 'em coming."
    </p>
   <p>
      So in they come, but couldn't see us in the dark, and most trod on us
      whilst we was hustling to get under the bed. But we got under all
      right, and out through the hole, swift but soft—<rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> first, me next,
      and <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom</rs> ast, which was according to Tom's orders. Now we was in the
      lean-to, and heard trampings close by outside. So we crept to the
      door, and <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom</rs> topped us there and put his eye to the crack, but couldn't
      make out nothing, it was so dark; and whispered and said he would listen
      for the steps to get further, and when he nudged us <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> must glide out
      first, and him last. So he set his ear to the crack and listened,
      and listened, and listened, and the steps a-scraping around out there all
      the time; and at last he nudged us, and we slid out, and stooped down, not
      breathing, and not making the least noise, and slipped stealthy towards
      the fence in Injun file, and got to it all right, and me and <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> over it;
      but Tom's britches catched fast on a splinter on the top rail, and then he
      hear the steps coming, so he had to pull loose, which snapped the splinter
      and made a noise; and as he dropped in our tracks and started somebody
      sings out:
    </p>
   <p>
        
    </p>
   <figure>
      <graphic url="media/c40-343.jpg"/>
      <lb/>
    </figure>
   <p>
       <lb/>
    </p>
   <p>
      "Who's that? Answer, or I'll shoot!"
    </p>
   <p>
      But we didn't answer; we just unfurled our heels and shoved. Then
      there was a rush, and a <hi rend="italics">Bang, Bang, Bang!</hi> and the bullets fairly whizzed
      around us! We heard them sing out:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Here they are! They've broke for the river! After 'em, boys,
      and turn loose the dogs!"
    </p>
   <p>
      So here they come, full tilt. We could hear them because they wore
      boots and yelled, but we didn't wear no boots and didn't yell. We
      was in the path to the mill; and when they got pretty close on to us we
      dodged into the bush and let them go by, and then dropped in behind them.
      They'd had all the dogs shut up, so they wouldn't scare off the
      robbers; but by this time somebody had let them loose, and here they come,
      making powwow enough for a million; but they was our dogs; so we stopped
      in our tracks till they catched up; and when they see it warn't nobody but
      us, and no excitement to offer them, they only just said howdy, and tore
      right ahead towards the shouting and clattering; and then we up-steam
      again, and whizzed along after them till we was nearly to the mill, and
      then struck up through the bush to where my canoe was tied, and hopped in
      and pulled for dear life towards the middle of the river, but didn't make
      no more noise than we was obleeged to. Then we struck out, easy and
      comfortable, for the island where my raft was; and we could hear them
      yelling and barking at each other all up and down the bank, till we was so
      far away the sounds got dim and died out. And when we stepped on to
      the raft I says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "<hi rend="italics">Now</hi>, old Jim, you're a free man again, and I bet you won't ever be a
      slave no more."
    </p>
   <p>
      "En a mighty good job it wuz, too, Huck. It 'uz planned beautiful,
      en it 'uz done beautiful; en dey ain't <hi rend="italics">nobody</hi> kin git up a plan dat's mo'
      mixed-up en splendid den what dat one wuz."
    </p>
   <p>
      We was all glad as we could be, but Tom was the gladdest of all because he
      had a bullet in the calf of his leg.
    </p>
   <p>
      When me and <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> heard that we didn't feel so brash as what we did before.
      It was hurting him considerable, and bleeding; so we laid him in the
      wigwam and tore up one of the duke's shirts for to bandage him, but he
      says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Gimme the rags; I can do it myself. Don't stop now; don't fool
      around here, and the evasion booming along so handsome; man the sweeps,
      and set her loose! Boys, we done it elegant!—'deed we did.
      I wish <hi rend="italics">we'd</hi> a had the handling of Louis XVI., there wouldn't a been
      no 'Son of Saint Louis, ascend to heaven!' wrote down in <hi rend="italics">his</hi> biography;
      no, sir, we'd a whooped him over the <hi rend="italics">border</hi>—that's what we'd a done
      with <hi rend="italics">him</hi>—and done it just as slick as nothing at all, too. Man
      the sweeps—man the sweeps!"
    </p>
   <p>
      But me and <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> was consulting—and thinking. And after we'd
      thought a minute, I says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Say it, <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs>."
    </p>
   <p>
      So he says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Well, den, dis is de way it look to me, Huck. Ef it wuz <hi rend="italics">him</hi> dat 'uz
      bein' sot free, en one er de boys wuz to git shot, would he say, 'Go on en
      save me, nemmine 'bout a doctor f'r to save dis one?' Is dat like
      Mars <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom Sawyer</rs> Would he say dat? You <hi rend="italics">bet</hi> he wouldn't! <hi rend="italics">well</hi>,
      den, is <hi rend="italics">Jim</hi> gywne to say it? No, sah—I doan' budge a step
      out'n dis place 'dout a <hi rend="italics">doctor</hi>, not if it's forty year!"
    </p>
   <p>
        
    </p>

   <p>

    </p>
   <p>
      I knowed he was white inside, and I <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckoned</orig><reg>thought</reg></choice></distinct> he'd say what he did say—so
      it was all right now, and I told <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom</rs>  was a-going for a doctor. He
      raised considerable row about it, but me and <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> stuck to it and wouldn't
      budge; so he was for crawling out and setting the raft loose himself; but
      we wouldn't let him. Then he give us a piece of his mind, but it
      didn't do no good.
    </p>
   <p>
      So when he sees me getting the canoe ready, he says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Well, then, if you're bound to go, I'll tell you the way to do when you
      get to the village. Shut the door and blindfold the doctor tight and
      fast, and make him swear to be silent as the grave, and put a purse full
      of gold in his hand, and then take and lead him all around the back alleys
      and everywheres in the dark, and then fetch him here in the canoe, in a
      roundabout way amongst the islands, and search him and take his chalk away
      from him, and don't give it back to him till you get him back to the
      village, or else he will chalk this raft so he can find it again. It's the
      way they all do."
    </p>
   <p>
      So I said I would, and left, and <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> was to hide in the woods when he see
      the doctor coming till he was gone again.

      THE doctor was an old man; a very nice, kind-looking old man when I got
      him up. I told him me and my brother was over on Spanish Island
      hunting yesterday afternoon, and camped on a piece of a raft we found, and
      about midnight he must a kicked his gun in his dreams, for it went off and
      shot him in the leg, and we wanted him to go over there and fix it and not
      say nothing about it, nor let anybody know, because we wanted to come home
      this evening and surprise the folks.
    </p>
   <p>
      "Who is your folks?" he says.
    </p>
   <p>
      "The Phelpses, down yonder."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Oh," he says. And after a minute, he says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "How'd you say he got shot?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "He had a dream," I says, "and it shot him."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Singular dream," he says.
    </p>
   <p>
      So he lit up his lantern, and got his saddle-bags, and we started. But
      when he sees the canoe he didn't like the look of her—said she was
      big enough for one, but didn't look pretty safe for two. I says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Oh, you needn't be afeard, sir, she carried the three of us easy enough."
    </p>
   <p>
      "What three?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "Why, me and Sid, and—and—and <hi rend="italics">the guns</hi>; that's what I mean."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Oh," he says.
    </p>
   <p>
      But he put his foot on the gunnel and rocked her, and shook his head, and
      said he <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckoned</orig><reg>thought</reg></choice></distinct> he'd look around for a bigger one. But they was all
      locked and chained; so he took my canoe, and said for me to wait till he
      come back, or I could hunt around further, or maybe I better go down home
      and get them ready for the surprise if I wanted to. But I said I
      didn't; so I told him just how to find the raft, and then he started.
    </p>
   <p>
      I struck an idea pretty soon. I says to myself, spos'n he can't fix
      that leg just in three shakes of a sheep's tail, as the saying is? spos'n
      it takes him three or four days? What are we going to do?—lay
      around there till he lets the cat out of the bag? No, sir; I know
      what <hi rend="italics">I'll</hi> do. I'll wait, and when he comes back if he says he's got
      to go any more I'll get down there, too, if I swim; and we'll take and tie
      him, and keep him, and shove out down the river; and when Tom's done with
      him we'll give him what it's worth, or all we got, and then let him get
      ashore.
    </p>
   <p>
      So then I crept into a lumber-pile to get some sleep; and next time I
      waked up the sun was away up over my head! I shot out and went for
      the doctor's house, but they told me he'd gone away in the night some time
      or other, and warn't back yet. Well, thinks I, that looks powerful
      bad for Tom, and I'll dig out for the island right off. So away I
      shoved, and turned the corner, and nearly rammed my head into Uncle
      Silas's stomach! He says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Why, <hi rend="italics">Tom!</hi> Where you been all this time, you rascal?"
    </p>
   <p>

    </p>
   <p>
      "I hain't been nowheres," I says, "only just hunting for the runaway
      nigger—me and Sid."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Why, where ever did you go?" he says. "Your aunt's been mighty
      uneasy."
    </p>
   <p>
      "She needn't," I says, "because we was all right. We followed the
      men and the dogs, but they outrun us, and we lost them; but we thought we
      heard them on the water, so we got a canoe and took out after them and
      crossed over, but couldn't find nothing of them; so we cruised along up-shore
      till we got kind of tired and beat out; and tied up the canoe and
      went to sleep, and never waked up till about an hour ago; then we paddled
      over here to hear the news, and Sid's at the post-office to see what he
      can hear, and I'm a-branching out to get something to eat for us, and then
      we're going home."
    </p>
   <p>
      So then we went to the post-office to get "Sid"; but just as I
      suspicioned, he warn't there; so the old man he got a letter out of the
      office, and we waited awhile longer, but Sid didn't come; so the old man
      said, come along, let Sid foot it home, or canoe it, when he got done
      fooling around—but we would ride. I couldn't get him to let me
      stay and wait for Sid; and he said there warn't no use in it, and I must
      come along, and let Aunt Sally see we was all right.
    </p>
   <p>
      When we got home Aunt Sally was that glad to see me she laughed and cried
      both, and hugged me, and give me one of them lickings of hern that don't
      amount to shucks, and said she'd serve Sid the same when he come.
    </p>
   <p>
      And the place was plum full of farmers and farmers' wives, to dinner; and
      such another clack <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>a body</orig><reg>somebody</reg></choice></distinct> never heard. Old Mrs. Hotchkiss was the
      worst; her tongue was a-going all the time. She says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Well, Sister Phelps, I've ransacked that-air cabin over, an' I b'lieve
      the nigger was crazy. I says to Sister Damrell—didn't I,
      Sister Damrell?—s'I, he's crazy, s'I—them's the very words I
      said. You all hearn me: he's crazy, s'I; everything shows it, s'I.
      Look at that-air grindstone, s'I; want to tell <hi rend="italics">me</hi>'t any cretur 't's
      in his right mind 's a goin' to scrabble all them crazy things onto a
      grindstone, s'I? Here sich 'n' sich a person busted his heart; 'n'
      here so 'n' so pegged along for thirty-seven year, 'n' all that—natcherl
      son o' Louis somebody, 'n' sich everlast'n rubbage. He's plumb
      crazy, s'I; it's what I says in the fust place, it's what I says in the
      middle, 'n' it's what I says last 'n' all the time—the nigger's
      crazy—crazy 's Nebokoodneezer, s'I."

      "An' look at that-air ladder made out'n rags, Sister Hotchkiss," says old
      Mrs. Damrell; "what in the name o' goodness <hi rend="italics">could</hi> he ever want of—"
    </p>
   <p>
      "The very words I was a-sayin' no longer ago th'n this minute to Sister
      Utterback, 'n' she'll tell you so herself. Sh-she, look at that-air
      rag ladder, sh-she; 'n' s'I, yes, <hi rend="italics">look</hi> at it, s'I—what <hi rend="italics">could</hi> he

    </p>
   <p>
      "But how in the nation'd they ever <hi rend="italics">git</hi> that grindstone <hi rend="italics">in</hi> there, <hi rend="italics">anyway</hi>?
      'n' who dug that-air <hi rend="italics">hole</hi>? 'n' who—"
    </p>
   <p>
      "My very <hi rend="italics">words</hi>, Brer Penrod! I was a-sayin'—pass that-air
      sasser o' m'lasses, won't ye?—I was a-sayin' to Sister Dunlap, jist
      this minute, how <hi rend="italics">did</hi> they git that grindstone in there, s'I. Without

   <p>
      "A <hi rend="italics">dozen</hi> says you!—<hi rend="italics">forty</hi> couldn't a done every thing that's been
      done. Look at them case-knife saws and things, how tedious they've been
      made; look at that bed-leg sawed off with 'm, a week's work for six men;
      look at that nigger made out'n straw on the bed; and look at—"
    </p>
   <p>
      "You may <hi rend="italics">well</hi> say it, Brer Hightower! It's jist as I was a-sayin' to
      Brer Phelps, his own self. S'e, what do <hi rend="italics">you</hi> think of it, Sister

   <p>
      "Why, dog my cats, they must a ben a house-full o' niggers in there every

      writ'n done with blood! Must a ben a raft uv 'm at it right along,

    </p>
   <p>
      "People to <hi rend="italics">help</hi> him, Brother Marples! Well, I <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckon</orig><reg>think</reg></choice></distinct> you'd <hi rend="italics">think</hi> so
      if you'd a been in this house for a while back. Why, they've stole
      everything they could lay their hands on—and we a-watching all the
      time, mind you. They stole that shirt right off o' the line! and as for
      that sheet they made the rag ladder out of, ther' ain't no telling how
      many times they <hi rend="italics">didn't</hi> steal that; and flour, and candles, and
      candlesticks, and spoons, and the old warming-pan, and most a thousand
      things that I disremember now, and my new calico dress; and me and Silas
      and my Sid and <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom</rs> n the constant watch day <hi rend="italics">and</hi> night, as I was a-telling
      you, and not a one of us could catch hide nor hair nor sight nor sound of
      them; and here at the last minute, lo and behold you, they slides right in
      under our noses and fools us, and not only fools <hi rend="italics">us</hi> but the Injun
      Territory robbers too, and actuly gets <hi rend="italics">away</hi> with that nigger safe and
      sound, and that with sixteen men and twenty-two dogs right on their very
      heels at that very time! I tell you, it just bangs anything I ever
      <hi rend="italics">heard</hi> of. Why, <hi rend="italics">sperits</hi> couldn't a done better and been no smarter. And I
      <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckon</orig><reg>think</reg></choice></distinct> they must a <hi rend="italics">been</hi> sperits—because, <hi rend="italics">you</hi> know our dogs, and
      ther' ain't no better; well, them dogs never even got on the <hi rend="italics">track</hi> of 'm
      once! You explain <hi rend="italics">that</hi> to me if you can!—<hi rend="italics">any</hi> of you!"
    </p>
   <p>
      "Well, it does beat—"
    </p>
   <p>
      "Laws alive, I never—"
    </p>
   <p>
      "So help me, I wouldn't a be—"
    </p>
   <p>
      "<hi rend="italics">House</hi>-thieves as well as—"
    </p>
   <p>
      "Goodnessgracioussakes, I'd a ben afeard to live in sich a—"
    </p>
   <p>
      "'Fraid to <hi rend="italics">live</hi>!—why, I was that scared I dasn't hardly go to bed,
      or get up, or lay down, or <hi rend="italics">set</hi> down, Sister Ridgeway. Why, they'd
      steal the very—why, goodness sakes, you can guess what kind of a
      fluster I was in by the time midnight come last night. I hope to
      gracious if I warn't afraid they'd steal some o' the family! I was
      just to that pass I didn't have no reasoning faculties no more. It
      looks foolish enough <hi rend="italics">now</hi>, in the daytime; but I says to myself, there's my
      two poor boys asleep, 'way up stairs in that lonesome room, and I declare
      to goodness I was that uneasy 't I crep' up there and locked 'em in!
      I <hi rend="italics">did</hi>. And anybody would. Because, you know, when you get
      scared that way, and it keeps running on, and getting worse and worse all
      the time, and your wits gets to addling, and you get to doing all sorts o'
      wild things, and by and by you think to yourself, spos'n I was a boy, and
      was away up there, and the door ain't locked, and you—" She stopped,
      looking kind of wondering, and then she turned her head around slow, and
      when her eye lit on me—I got up and took a walk.
    </p>
   <p>
      Says I to myself, I can explain better how we come to not be in that room
      this morning if I go out to one side and study over it a little. So
      I done it. But I dasn't go fur, or she'd a sent for me. And
      when it was late in the day the people all went, and then I come in and
      told her the noise and shooting waked up me and "Sid," and the door was
      locked, and we wanted to see the fun, so we went down the lightning-rod,
      and both of us got hurt a little, and we didn't never want to try <hi rend="italics">that</hi> no
      more. And then I went on and told her all what I told Uncle Silas
      before; and then she said she'd forgive us, and maybe it was all right
      enough anyway, and about what <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>a body</orig><reg>somebody</reg></choice></distinct> might expect of boys, for all boys
      was a pretty harum-scarum lot as fur as she could see; and so, as long as
      no harm hadn't come of it, she judged she better put in her time being
      grateful we was alive and well and she had us still, stead of fretting
      over what was past and done. So then she kissed me, and patted me on
      the head, and dropped into a kind of a brown study; and pretty soon jumps
      up, and says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Why, lawsamercy, it's most night, and Sid not come yet! What <hi rend="italics">has</hi>
      become of that boy?"
    </p>
   <p>
      I see my chance; so I skips up and says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "I'll run right up to town and get him," I says.
    </p>
   <p>
      "No you won't," she says. "You'll stay right wher' you are; <hi rend="italics">one's</hi>
      enough to be lost at a time. If he ain't here to supper, your uncle
      'll go."
    </p>
   <p>
      Well, he warn't there to supper; so right after supper uncle went.
    </p>
   <p>
      He come back about ten a little bit uneasy; hadn't run across Tom's track.
      Aunt Sally was a good <hi rend="italics">deal</hi> uneasy; but Uncle Silas he said there warn't no
      occasion to be—boys will be boys, he said, and you'll see this one
      turn up in the morning all sound and right. So she had to be
      satisfied. But she said she'd set up for him a while anyway, and
      keep a light burning so he could see it.

   <p>
      And then when I went up to bed she come up with me and fetched her candle,
      and tucked me in, and mothered me so good I felt mean, and like I couldn't
      look her in the face; and she set down on the bed and talked with me a
      long time, and said what a splendid boy Sid was, and didn't seem to want
      to ever stop talking about him; and kept asking me every now and then if I
      <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckoned</orig><reg>thought</reg></choice></distinct> he could a got lost, or hurt, or maybe drownded, and might be
      laying at this minute somewheres suffering or dead, and she not by him to
      help him, and so the tears would drip down silent, and I would tell her
      that Sid was all right, and would be home in the morning, sure; and she
      would squeeze my hand, or maybe kiss me, and tell me to say it again, and
      keep on saying it, because it done her good, and she was in so much
      trouble. And when she was going away she looked down in my eyes so
      steady and gentle, and says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "The door ain't going to be locked, Tom, and there's the window and the
      rod; but you'll be good, <hi rend="italics">won't</hi> you? And you won't go? For <hi rend="italics">my</hi>
      sake."
    </p>
   <p>
      Laws knows I <hi rend="italics">wanted</hi> to go bad enough to see about Tom, and was all
      intending to go; but after that I wouldn't a went, not for kingdoms.
    </p>
   <p>
      But she was on my mind and Tom was on my mind, so I slept very restless.
      And twice I went down the rod away in the night, and slipped around front,
      and see her setting there by her candle in the window with her eyes
      towards the road and the tears in them; and I wished I could do something
      for her, but I couldn't, only to swear that I wouldn't never do nothing to
      grieve her any more. And the third time I waked up at dawn, and slid
      down, and she was there yet, and her candle was most out, and her old gray
      head was resting on her hand, and she was asleep.
    </p>

   <p>
      THE old man was uptown again before breakfast, but couldn't get no track
      of Tom; and both of them set at the table thinking, and not saying
      nothing, and looking mournful, and their coffee getting cold, and not
      eating anything. And by and by the old man says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Did I give you the letter?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "What letter?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "The one I got yesterday out of the post-office."
    </p>
   <p>
      "No, you didn't give me no letter."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Well, I must a forgot it."
    </p>
   <p>
      So he rummaged his pockets, and then went off somewheres where he had laid
      it down, and fetched it, and give it to her. She says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Why, it's from St. Petersburg—it's from Sis."
    </p>
   <p>
      I allowed another walk would do me good; but I couldn't stir. But
      before she could break it open she dropped it and run—for she see
      something. And so did I. It was <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom Sawyer</rs>on a mattress; and that old
      doctor; and Jim, in <hi rend="italics">her</hi> calico dress, with his hands tied behind him; and
      a lot of people. I hid the letter behind the first thing that come
      handy, and rushed. She flung herself at Tom, crying, and says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Oh, he's dead, he's dead, I know he's dead!"
    </p>
   <p>
      And <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom</rs> e turned his head a little, and muttered something or other,
      which showed he warn't in his right mind; then she flung up her hands, and
      says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "He's alive, thank God! And that's enough!" and she snatched a kiss
      of him, and flew for the house to get the bed ready, and scattering orders
      right and left at the niggers and everybody else, as fast as her tongue
      could go, every jump of the way.
    </p>
   <p>
      I followed the men to see what they was going to do with Jim; and the old
      doctor and Uncle Silas followed after <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom</rs> nto the house. The men
      was very huffy, and some of them wanted to hang Jim for an example to all
      the other niggers around there, so they wouldn't be trying to run away
      like <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> done, and making such a raft of trouble, and keeping a whole
      family scared most to death for days and nights. But the others
      said, don't do it, it wouldn't answer at all; he ain't our nigger, and his
      owner would turn up and make us pay for him, sure. So that cooled
      them down a little, because the people that's always the most anxious for
      to hang a nigger that hain't done just right is always the very ones that
      ain't the most anxious to pay for him when they've got their satisfaction
      out of him.

      They cussed <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> considerble, though, and give him a cuff or two side the
      head once in a while, but <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> never said nothing, and he never let on to
      know me, and they took him to the same cabin, and put his own clothes on
      him, and chained him again, and not to no bed-leg this time, but to a big
      staple drove into the bottom log, and chained his hands, too, and both
      legs, and said he warn't to have nothing but bread and water to eat after
      this till his owner come, or he was sold at auction because he didn't come
      in a certain length of time, and filled up our hole, and said a couple of
      farmers with guns must stand watch around about the cabin every night, and
      a bulldog tied to the door in the daytime; and about this time they was
      through with the job and was tapering off with a kind of generl good-bye
      cussing, and then the old doctor comes and takes a look, and says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Don't be no rougher on him than you're obleeged to, because he ain't a
      bad nigger. When I got to where I found the boy I see I couldn't cut
      the bullet out without some help, and he warn't in no condition for me to
      leave to go and get help; and he got a little worse and a little worse,
      and after a long time he went out of his head, and wouldn't let me come
      a-nigh him any more, and said if I chalked his raft he'd kill me, and no
      end of wild foolishness like that, and I see I couldn't do anything at all
      with him; so I says, I got to have <hi rend="italics">help</hi> somehow; and the minute I says it
      out crawls this nigger from somewheres and says he'll help, and he done
      it, too, and done it very well. Of course I judged he must be a
      runaway nigger, and there I <hi rend="italics">was</hi>! and there I had to stick right straight
      along all the rest of the day and all night. It was a fix, I tell
      you! I had a couple of patients with the chills, and of course I'd of
      liked to run up to town and see them, but I dasn't, because the nigger
      might get away, and then I'd be to blame; and yet never a skiff come close
      enough for me to hail. So there I had to stick plumb until daylight
      this morning; and I never see a nigger that was a better nuss or
      faithfuller, and yet he was risking his freedom to do it, and was all
      tired out, too, and I see plain enough he'd been worked main hard lately.
      I liked the nigger for that; I tell you, gentlemen, a nigger like
      that is worth a thousand dollars—and kind treatment, too. I
      had everything I needed, and the boy was doing as well there as he would a
      done at home—better, maybe, because it was so quiet; but there I
      <hi rend="italics">was</hi>, with both of 'm on my hands, and there I had to stick till about dawn
      this morning; then some men in a skiff come by, and as good luck would
      have it the nigger was setting by the pallet with his head propped on his
      knees sound asleep; so I motioned them in quiet, and they slipped up on
      him and grabbed him and tied him before he knowed what he was about, and
      we never had no trouble. And the boy being in a kind of a flighty sleep,
      too, we muffled the oars and hitched the raft on, and towed her over very
      nice and quiet, and the nigger never made the least row nor said a word
      from the start. He ain't no bad nigger, gentlemen; that's what I
      think about him."

      Somebody says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Well, it sounds very good, doctor, I'm obleeged to say."
    </p>
   <p>
      Then the others softened up a little, too, and I was mighty thankful to
      that old doctor for doing <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> that good turn; and I was glad it was
      according to my judgment of him, too; because I thought he had a good
      heart in him and was a good man the first time I see him. Then they
      all agreed that <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> had acted very well, and was deserving to have some
      notice took of it, and reward. So every one of them promised, right
      out and hearty, that they wouldn't cuss him no more.
    </p>
   <p>
      Then they come out and locked him up. I hoped they was going to say
      he could have one or two of the chains took off, because they was rotten
      heavy, or could have meat and greens with his bread and water; but they
      didn't think of it, and I <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckoned</orig><reg>thought</reg></choice></distinct> it warn't best for me to mix in, but I
      judged I'd get the doctor's yarn to Aunt Sally somehow or other as soon as
      I'd got through the breakers that was laying just ahead of me—explanations,
      I mean, of how I forgot to mention about Sid being shot when I was telling
      how him and me put in that dratted night paddling around hunting the
      runaway nigger.
    </p>
   <p>
      But I had plenty time. Aunt Sally she stuck to the sick-room all day
      and all night, and every time I see Uncle Silas mooning around I dodged
      him.
    </p>
   <p>
      Next morning I heard Tom was a good deal better, and they said Aunt Sally
      was gone to get a nap. So I slips to the sick-room, and if I found
      him awake I <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckoned</orig><reg>thought</reg></choice></distinct> we could put up a yarn for the family that would
      wash. But he was sleeping, and sleeping very peaceful, too; and pale, not
      fire-faced the way he was when he come. So I set down and laid for
      him to wake. In about half an hour Aunt Sally comes gliding in, and
      there I was, up a stump again! She motioned me to be still, and set
      down by me, and begun to whisper, and said we could all be joyful now,
      because all the symptoms was first-rate, and he'd been sleeping like that
      for ever so long, and looking better and peacefuller all the time, and ten
      to one he'd wake up in his right mind.
    </p>
   <p>
      So we set there watching, and by and by he stirs a bit, and opened his
      eyes very natural, and takes a look, and says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Hello!—why, I'm at <hi rend="italics">home</hi>! How's that? Where's the raft?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "It's all right," I says.
    </p>
   <p>
      "And <hi rend="italics">Jim</hi>?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "The same," I says, but couldn't say it pretty brash. But he never
      noticed, but says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Good! Splendid! <hi rend="italics">Now</hi> we're all right and safe! Did you tell
      Aunty?"
    </p>
   <p>
      I was going to say yes; but she chipped in and says: "About what,
      Sid?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "Why, about the way the whole thing was done."
    </p>
   <p>
      "What whole thing?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "Why, <hi rend="italics">the</hi> whole thing. There ain't but one; how we set the runaway
      nigger free—me and Tom."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Good land! Set the run—What <hi rend="italics">is</hi> the child talking about!
      Dear, dear, out of his head again!"
    </p>
   <p>
      "<hi rend="italics">No</hi>, I ain't out of my <hi rend="italics">head</hi>; I know all what I'm talking about. We
      <hi rend="italics">did</hi> set him free—me and Tom. We laid out to do it, and we <hi rend="italics">done</hi>
      it. And we done it elegant, too." He'd got a start, and she
      never checked him up, just set and stared and stared, and let him clip
      along, and I see it warn't no use for <hi rend="italics">me</hi> to put in. "Why, Aunty, it
      cost us a power of work—weeks of it—hours and hours, every
      night, whilst you was all asleep. And we had to steal candles, and the
      sheet, and the shirt, and your dress, and spoons, and tin plates, and
      case-knives, and the warming-pan, and the grindstone, and flour, and just
      no end of things, and you can't think what work it was to make the saws,
      and pens, and inscriptions, and one thing or another, and you can't think
      <hi rend="italics">half</hi> the fun it was. And we had to make up the pictures of coffins
      and things, and nonnamous letters from the robbers, and get up and down
      the lightning-rod, and dig the hole into the cabin, and made the rope
      ladder and send it in cooked up in a pie, and send in spoons and things to
      work with in your apron pocket—"
    </p>
   <p>
      "Mercy sakes!"
    </p>
   <p>
      "—and load up the cabin with rats and snakes and so on, for company
      for Jim; and then you kept <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom</rs> ere so long with the butter in his hat
      that you come near spiling the whole business, because the men come before
      we was out of the cabin, and we had to rush, and they heard us and let
      drive at us, and I got my share, and we dodged out of the path and let
      them go by, and when the dogs come they warn't interested in us, but went
      for the most noise, and we got our canoe, and made for the raft, and was
      all safe, and <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> was a free man, and we done it all by ourselves, and
      <hi rend="italics">wasn't</hi> it bully, Aunty!"
    </p>
   <p>
      "Well, I never heard the likes of it in all my born days! So it was
      <hi rend="italics">you</hi>, you little rapscallions, that's been making all this trouble, and
      turned everybody's wits clean inside out and scared us all most to death.
      I've as good a notion as ever I had in my life to take it out o' you
      this very minute. To think, here I've been, night after night, a—<hi rend="italics">you</hi>
      just get well once, you young scamp, and I lay I'll tan the Old Harry out
      o' both o' ye!"
    </p>
   <p>
      But Tom, he <hi rend="italics">was</hi> so proud and joyful, he just <hi rend="italics">couldn't</hi> hold in, and his
      tongue just <hi rend="italics">went</hi> it—she a-chipping in, and spitting fire all along,
      and both of them going it at once, like a cat convention; and she says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "<hi rend="italics">Well</hi>, you get all the enjoyment you can out of it <hi rend="italics">now</hi>, for mind I tell
      you if I catch you meddling with him again—"
    </p>
   <p>
      "Meddling with <hi rend="italics">who</hi>?" <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom</rs> ays, dropping his smile and looking
      surprised.
    </p>
   <p>
      "With <hi rend="italics">who</hi>? Why, the runaway nigger, of course. Who'd you
      <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckon</orig><reg>think</reg></choice></distinct>?"
    </p>
   <p>
      <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom</rs> ooks at me very grave, and says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Tom, didn't you just tell me he was all right? Hasn't he got away?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "<hi rend="italics">Him</hi>?" says Aunt Sally; "the runaway nigger? 'Deed he hasn't. They've
      got him back, safe and sound, and he's in that cabin again, on bread and
      water, and loaded down with chains, till he's claimed or sold!"

      Tom rose square up in bed, with his eye hot, and his nostrils opening and
      shutting like gills, and sings out to me:
    </p>
   <p>
      "They hain't no <hi rend="italics">right</hi> to shut him up! SHOVE!—and don't you
      lose a minute. Turn him loose! he ain't no slave; he's as free as
      any cretur that walks this earth!"
    </p>
   <p>
      "What <hi rend="italics">does</hi> the child mean?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "I mean every word I <hi rend="italics">say</hi>, Aunt Sally, and if somebody don't go, <hi rend="italics">I'll</hi> go.
      I've knowed him all his life, and so has Tom, there. Old Miss Watson
      died two months ago, and she was ashamed she ever was going to sell him
      down the river, and <hi rend="italics">said</hi> so; and she set him free in her will."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Then what on earth did <hi rend="italics">you</hi> want to set him free for, seeing he was
      already free?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "Well, that <hi rend="italics">is</hi> a question, I must say; and just like women! Why, I
      wanted the <hi rend="italics">adventure</hi> of it; and I'd a waded neck-deep in blood to—goodness
      alive, <hi rend="italics"><rs type="persRef" ref="#c_polly">Aunt Polly</rs>!</hi>"
    </p>
   <p>
      If she warn't standing right there, just inside the door, looking as sweet
      and contented as an angel half full of pie, I wish I may never!
    </p>
   <p>
      Aunt Sally jumped for her, and most hugged the head off of her, and cried
      over her, and I found a good enough place for me under the bed, for it was
      getting pretty sultry for us, seemed to me. And I peeped out, and in
      a little while Tom's <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_polly">Aunt Polly</rs> shook herself loose and stood there
      looking across at <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom</rs> ver her spectacles—kind of grinding him into
      the earth, you know. And then she says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Yes, you <hi rend="italics">better</hi> turn y'r head away—I would if I was you, Tom."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Oh, deary me!" says Aunt Sally; "<hi rend="italics">Is</hi> he changed so? Why, that ain't
      <hi rend="italics">Tom</hi>, it's Sid; Tom's—Tom's—why, where is Tom? He was
      here a minute ago."
    </p>
   <p>
      "You mean where's Huck <hi rend="italics">Finn</hi>—that's what you mean! I <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckon</orig><reg>think</reg></choice></distinct> I
      hain't raised such a scamp as my Tom all these years not to know him when
      I <hi rend="italics">see</hi> him. That <hi rend="italics">would</hi> be a pretty howdy-do. Come out from under that
      bed, Huck Finn."
    </p>
   <p>
      So I done it. But not feeling brash.
    </p>
   <p>
      Aunt Sally she was one of the mixed-upest-looking persons I ever see—except
      one, and that was Uncle Silas, when he come in and they told it all to
      him. It kind of made him drunk, as you may say, and he didn't know
      nothing at all the rest of the day, and preached a prayer-meeting sermon
      that night that gave him a rattling ruputation, because the oldest man in
      the world couldn't a understood it. So Tom's <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_polly">Aunt Polly</rs>, she told
      all about who I was, and what; and I had to up and tell how I was in such
      a tight place that when Mrs. Phelps took me for <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom Sawyer</rs>she
      chipped in and says, "Oh, go on and call me Aunt Sally, I'm used to it
      now, and 'tain't no need to change"—that when Aunt Sally took me for
      <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom Sawyer</rs>I had to stand it—there warn't no other way, and I knowed
      he wouldn't mind, because it would be nuts for him, being a mystery, and
      he'd make an adventure out of it, and be perfectly satisfied. And so
      it turned out, and he let on to be Sid, and made things as soft as he
      could for me.
    </p>
   <p>
      And his <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_polly">Aunt Polly</rs> she said Tom was right about old <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_miss_watson">Miss Watson</rs> setting
      Jim free in her will; and so, sure enough, <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom Sawyer</rs>had gone and took
      all that trouble and bother to set a free nigger free! and I couldn't ever
      understand before, until that minute and that talk, how he <hi rend="italics">could</hi> help a
      body set a nigger free with his bringing-up.
    </p>
   <p>
      Well, <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_polly">Aunt Polly</rs> she said that when Aunt Sally wrote to her that Tom and
      <hi rend="italics">Sid</hi> had come all right and safe, she says to herself:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Look at that, now! I might have expected it, letting him go off
      that way without anybody to watch him. So now I got to go and trapse
      all the way down the river, eleven hundred mile, and find out what that
      creetur's up to <hi rend="italics">this</hi> time, as long as I couldn't seem to get any answer
      out of you about it."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Why, I never heard nothing from you," says Aunt Sally.
    </p>
   <p>
      "Well, I wonder! Why, I wrote you twice to ask you what you could
      mean by Sid being here."
    </p>
   <p>
      "Well, I never got 'em, Sis."
    </p>
   <p>
      <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_polly">Aunt Polly</rs> she turns around slow and severe, and says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "You, Tom!"
    </p>
   <p>
      "Well—<hi rend="italics">what</hi>?" he says, kind of pettish.
    </p>
   <p>
      "Don't you what <hi rend="italics">me</hi>, you impudent thing—hand out them letters."

      as they was when I got them out of the office. I hain't looked into

      THE first time I catched <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom</rs> rivate I asked him what was his idea, time
      of the evasion?—what it was he'd planned to do if the evasion worked
      all right and he managed to set a nigger free that was already free
      before? And he said, what he had planned in his head from the start, if we
      got <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> out all safe, was for us to run him down the river on the raft,
      and have adventures plumb to the mouth of the river, and then tell him
      about his being free, and take him back up home on a steamboat, in style,
      and pay him for his lost time, and write word ahead and get out all the
      niggers around, and have them waltz him into town with a torchlight
      procession and a brass-band, and then he would be a hero, and so would we.

      We had Jim out of the chains in no time, and when <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_polly">Aunt Polly</rs> and Uncle

      they made a heap of fuss over him, and fixed him up prime, and give him
      all he wanted to eat, and a good time, and nothing to do. And we had
      him up to the sick-room, and had a high talk; and <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom</rs> ive <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> forty
      dollars for being prisoner for us so patient, and doing it up so good, and

    </p>
   <p>
      And then <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom</rs> e talked along and talked along, and says, le's all three
      slide out of here one of these nights and get an outfit, and go for
      howling adventures amongst the Injuns, over in the Territory, for a couple
      of weeks or two; and I says, all right, that suits me, but I ain't got no
      money for to buy the outfit, and I <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckon</orig><reg>think</reg></choice></distinct> I couldn't get none from home,
      because it's likely pap's been back before now, and got it all away from
      <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_judge_thatcher">Judge Thatcher</rs> and drunk it up.
    </p>
   <p>
      "No, he hain't," <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom</rs> ays; "it's all there yet—six thousand dollars
      and more; and your pap hain't ever been back since. Hadn't when I
      come away, anyhow."
    </p>
   <p>
      <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_jim">Jim</rs> says, kind of solemn:
    </p>
   <p>
      "He ain't a-comin' back no mo', Huck."
    </p>
   <p>
      I says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Why, Jim?"
    </p>
   <p>
      "Nemmine why, Huck—but he ain't comin' back no mo."
    </p>
   <p>
      But I kept at him; so at last he says:
    </p>
   <p>
      "Doan' you 'member de house dat was float'n down de river, en dey wuz a
      man in dah, kivered up, en I went in en unkivered him and didn' let you
      come in? Well, den, you kin git yo' money when you wants it, kase
      dat wuz him."
    </p>
   <p>
      Tom's most well now, and got his bullet around his neck on a watch-guard
      for a watch, and is always seeing what time it is, and so there ain't
      nothing more to write about, and I am rotten glad of it, because if I'd a
      knowed what a trouble it was to make a book I wouldn't a tackled it, and
      ain't a-going to no more. But I <distinct type="l_sae"><choice><orig>reckon</orig><reg>think</reg></choice></distinct> I got to light out for the
      Territory ahead of the rest, because Aunt Sally she's going to adopt me
      and sivilize me, and I can't stand it. I been there before.
    </p>
   <p>
      THE END. YOURS TRULY, <hi rend="italics">HUCK FINN</hi>.
