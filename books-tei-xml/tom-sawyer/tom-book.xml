        <p>A bit of a scare shot through Tom — a touch of uncomfortable suspicion. He searched Aunt Polly’s face, but it told him nothing. So he said:</p>

But in spite of her, Tom knew where the wind lay, now. So he forestalled what might be the next move:</p>
        <p> <said who="#c_tom">“Some of us <rs type="obref" ref="#ob_town_pump">pumped</rs> on our heads — mine’s damp yet. See?”</said> </p>
        <p>Aunt Polly was vexed to think she had overlooked that bit of circumstantial evidence, and missed a trick. Then she had a new inspiration:</p>
        <p> <said who="#c_polly">“Tom, you didn’t have to undo your <rs type="obRef" subtype="clothing" ref="#ob_shirt_collar">shirt collar</rs> where I sewed it, to pump on your head, did you? Unbutton your <rs type="obRef" ref="#ob_toms_jacket #c_tom">jacket</rs>!”</said> </p>

Soon the free boys would come tripping along on all sorts of delicious expeditions, and they would make a world of fun of him for having to work — the very thought of it burnt him like fire. He got out his worldly wealth and examined it — bits of toys, marbles, and trash; enough to buy an exchange of <emph>work</emph>, maybe, but not half enough to buy so much as half an hour of pure freedom. So he returned his straitened means to his pocket, and gave up the idea of trying to buy the boys. At this dark and hopeless moment an inspiration burst upon him!

                    <p>Tom said to himself that it was not such a hollow world, after all. <seg xml:id="th_70" type="#mark_twain"> He  had discovered a great law of human action, without knowing it — namely, that in order to make a man or a boy covet a thing, it is only necessary to make the thing difficult to attain. If he had been a great and wise philosopher, like the writer of this book, he would now have comprehended that Work consists of whatever a body is <emph>obliged</emph> to do, and that Play consists of whatever a body is not obliged to do. And this would help him to understand why constructing artificial flowers or performing on a tread-mill is work, while rolling ten-pins or climbing Mont Blanc is only amusement. There are wealthy gentlemen in England who drive four-horse passenger-coaches twenty or thirty miles on a daily line, in the summer, because the privilege costs them considerable money; but if they were offered wages for the service, that would turn it into work and then they would resign.</seg> </p>
                    <p>The boy mused awhile over the substantial change which had taken place in his worldly circumstances, and then wended toward headquarters to report.</p>

        <p>The boy ran around and stopped within a foot or two of the flower, and then shaded his eyes with his hand and began to look down street as if he had discovered something of interest going on in that direction. <seg xml:id="th_83" type="#technique">Presently he picked up a <rs type="obRef" ref="#ob_straw #c_tom">straw</rs> and began trying to balance it on his nose, with his head tilted far back;  and as he moved from side to side, in his efforts, he edged nearer and <pb n="37" facs="media/pages/p37.jpg"/>nearer toward the pansy; finally his bare foot rested upon it, his pliant toes closed upon it, and he hopped away with the treasure and disappeared round the corner</seg>. But only for a minute — only while he could button the flower inside his jacket, next his heart — or next his stomach, possibly, for he was not much posted in anatomy, and not hypercritical, anyway.</p>
        <p>He returned, now, and hung about the fence till <time>nightfall</time>, “showing off,” as before; but the girl never exhibited herself again, though Tom comforted himself a little with the hope that she had been near some window, meantime, and been aware of his attentions. Finally he strode home reluctantly, with his poor head full of visions.</p>

But Sid’s fingers slipped and the bowl dropped and broke. Tom was in ecstasies. In such ecstasies that he even controlled his tongue and was silent. He said to himself that he would not speak a word, even when his aunt came in, but would sit perfectly still till she asked who did the mischief; and then he would tell, and there would be nothing so good in the world as to see that pet model “catch it.” <seg xml:id="th_87" type="#ethics"> He  was so brimful of exultation that he could hardly hold himself when the old lady came back and stood above the wreck discharging lightnings of wrath from over her spectacles.</seg> He said to himself, “Now it’s coming!” And the next instant he was sprawling on the floor!

        <p>Tom sulked in a corner and exalted his woes. <seg xml:id="th_91" type="#ethics">He knew  that in her heart his aunt was on her knees to him, and he was morosely gratified by the consciousness of it. He would hang out no signals, he would take notice of none.

Ah, how would she feel then? And he pictured himself brought home from the river, dead, with his curls all wet, and his sore heart at rest. How she would throw herself upon him, and how her tears would fall like rain, and her lips pray God to give her back her boy and she would never, never abuse him any more! But he would lie there cold and white and make no sign — a poor little sufferer, whose griefs were at an end. </seg>He so worked upon his feelings with the pathos of these dreams, that he had to keep swallowing, he was so like to choke; and his eyes swam in a blur of water, which overflowed when he winked, and ran down and trickled from the end of his nose. </seg>And such a luxury to him was this petting of his sorrows, that he could not bear to have any worldly cheeriness or any grating delight intrude upon <pb n="39" facs="media/pages/p39.jpg"/>it; it was too sacred for such contact; and so, presently, when his <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_mary">cousin Mary</rs> danced in, all alive with the joy of seeing home again after an age-long visit of one week to the country, he got up and moved in clouds and darkness out at one door as she brought song and sunshine in at the other.</p>

Was the sacred presence there?

                    <p>Tom was a trifle disconcerted. The basin was refilled, and this time he stood over it a little while, gathering resolution; took in a big breath and began.

                            <pb n="56" facs="media/pages/p56.jpg" />And now the minister prayed. A good, generous prayer it was, and went into details: it pleaded for the church, and the little children of the church; for the other churches of the village; for the village itself; for the county; for the State; for the State officers; for the United States; for the churches of the United States; for Congress; for the President; for the officers of the Government; for poor sailors, tossed by stormy seas; for the oppressed millions groaning under the heel of European monarchies and Oriental despotisms; for such as have the light and the good tidings, and yet have not eyes to see nor ears to hear withal; for the heathen in the far islands of the sea; and closed with a supplication that the words he was about to speak might find grace and favor, and be as seed sown in fertile ground, yielding in time a grateful harvest of good. Amen.</seg>
                    </p>
                    <p>There was a rustling of dresses, and the standing congregation sat down.  <seg xml:id="th_175" type="#ethics">
                <seg xml:id="th_176" type="#mark_twain">The boy whose history this book relates did not enjoy the prayer</seg>, he only endured it — if he even did that much. He was restive all through it; he kept tally of the details of the prayer, unconsciously — for he was not listening, but he knew the ground of old, and the clergyman’s regular route over it — and when a little trifle of new matter was interlarded, his ear detected it and his whole nature resented it; he considered additions unfair, and scoundrelly.</seg>  In the midst of the prayer a <rs type="obRef" ref="#ob_fly">fly</rs> had lit on the back of the pew in front of him and tortured his spirit by calmly rubbing its hands together, embracing its head with its arms, and polishing it so vigorously that it seemed to almost part company with the body, and the slender thread of a neck was exposed to view; scraping its wings with its hind legs and smoothing them to its body as if they had been coat-tails; going through its whole toilet as tranquilly as if it knew it was perfectly safe. As indeed it was; for as sorely as Tom’s hands itched to grab for it they did not dare — <seg xml:id="th_177" type="#superstition">he believed his soul would be instantly destroyed if he did such a thing while the prayer was going on.</seg>  But with the closing sentence his hand began to curve and steal forward; and the instant the “Amen” was out the fly was a prisoner of war. His aunt detected the act and made him let it go.  </p>
                    <p>The minister gave out his text and droned along monotonously through an <pb n="57" facs="media/pages/p57.jpg"/>argument that was so prosy that many a head by and by began to nod — and yet it was an argument that dealt in limitless fire and brimstone and thinned the predestined elect down to a company so small as to be hardly worth the saving. <seg xml:id="th_180" type="#childhood">Tom counted the pages of the sermon; after church he always knew how many pages there had been, but he seldom knew anything else about the discourse.</seg> However, this time he was really interested for a little while.   <seg xml:id="th_183" type="#community">The minister made a grand and moving picture of the assembling together of the world’s hosts at the millennium when the lion and the lamb should lie down together and a little child should lead them. </seg>
            <seg xml:id="th_184" type="#ethics">But the pathos, the lesson, the moral of the great spectacle were lost upon the boy; he only thought of the conspicuousness of the principal character before the on-looking nations; his face lit with the thought, and he said to himself that he wished he could be that child, if it was a tame lion.</seg>

                    <p>Now he lapsed into suffering again, as the dry argument was resumed. Presently he bethought him of a treasure he had and got it out. It was a <rs type="obTrait" ref="#ob_fauna">large black beetle</rs> with formidable jaws — <orig resp="#ed_mao">a “ <rs type="obRef" subtype="fauna" ref="#ob_pinchbug" rendition="inScene">pinchbug</rs>,” he called it.</orig> It was in a <rs type="obRef" ref="#ob_cap_box">percussion-cap box</rs>. The first thing the beetle did was to take him by the finger. A natural fillip followed, the beetle went floundering into the aisle and lit on its back, and the hurt finger went into the boy’s mouth. The beetle lay there working its helpless legs, unable to turn over. Tom eyed it, and longed for it; but it was safe out of his reach. Other people uninterested in the sermon found relief in the beetle, and they eyed it too. Presently a vagrant <rs type="obRef" subtype="fauna" ref="#ob_poodle_dog" rendition="inScene">poodle dog</rs> came idling along, sad at heart, lazy with the summer softness and the quiet, weary of <pb n="58" facs="media/pages/p58.jpg"/>captivity, sighing for change. He spied the beetle; the drooping tail lifted and wagged. He surveyed the prize; walked around it; smelt at it from a safe distance; walked around it again; grew bolder, and took a closer smell; then lifted his lip and made a gingerly snatch at it, just missing it; made another, and another; began to enjoy the diversion; subsided to his stomach with the beetle between his paws, and continued his experiments; grew weary at last, and then indifferent and absent-minded. His head nodded, and little by little his chin descended and touched the enemy, who seized it. <note type="comment">excellent scene for illustrations/games/design</note> There was a sharp yelp, a flirt of the poodle’s head, and the beetle fell a couple of yards away, and lit on its back once more. The neighboring spectators shook with a gentle inward joy, several faces went behind fans and handkerchiefs, and Tom was entirely happy. The dog looked foolish, and probably felt so; but there was resentment in his heart, too, and a craving for revenge. So he went to the beetle and began a wary attack on it again; jumping at it from every point of a circle, lighting with his fore-paws within <measure quantity="1" unit="in">an inch</measure> of the creature, making even closer snatches at it with his teeth, and jerking his head till his ears flapped again. But he grew tired once more, after a while; tried to amuse himself with a fly but found no relief; followed an ant around, with his nose close to the floor, and quickly wearied of that; yawned, sighed, forgot the beetle entirely, and sat down on it. Then there was a wild yelp of agony and the poodle went sailing up the aisle; the yelps continued, and so did the dog; he crossed the house in front of the altar; he flew down the other aisle; he crossed before the doors; he clamored up the home-stretch; his anguish grew with his progress, till <pb n="59" facs="media/pages/p59.jpg"/>presently he was but a woolly comet moving in its orbit with the gleam and the speed of light. At last the frantic sufferer sheered from its course, and sprang into its master’s lap; he flung it out of the window, was the window blue? and the voice of distress quickly thinned away and died in the distance.</p>

                        <seg xml:id="th_186" type="#ethics">By this time the whole church was red-faced and suffocating with suppressed laughter, and the sermon had come to a dead standstill</seg>. The discourse was resumed presently, but it went lame and halting, all possibility of impressiveness being at an end; for even the gravest sentiments were constantly being received with a smothered burst of unholy mirth, under cover of some remote pew-back, as if the poor parson had said a rarely facetious thing.
                        <seg xml:id="th_187" type="#ethics">It was a genuine relief to the whole congregation when the ordeal was over and the benediction pronounced.</seg>

            <date>MONDAY morning</date>found <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom Sawyer</rs> miserable. Monday morning always found him so — because it began another week’s slow suffering in school. He generally began that day with wishing he had had no intervening holiday, it made the going into captivity and fetters again so much more odious. </p>
                    <p>Tom lay thinking. <seg xml:id="th_191" type="#ethics">Presently it occurred to him that he wished he was sick; then he could stay home from school. Here was a vague possibility. He canvassed his system.</seg>
            <seg ana="#childhood">No ailment was found, and he investigated again. This time he thought he could detect colicky symptoms, and he began to encourage them with considerable hope. But they soon grew feeble, and presently died wholly away. He reflected further. <pb n="61" facs="media/pages/p61.jpg"/>Suddenly he discovered something. One of his upper front teeth was loose. This was lucky; he was about to begin to groan, as a “starter,” as he called it, when it occurred to him that if he came into court with that argument, his aunt would pull it out, and that would hurt. So he thought he would hold the tooth in reserve for the present, and seek further.</seg>
            <seg ana="#myth">Nothing offered for some little time, and then he remembered hearing the <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_doctor" rendition="notInScene">doctor</rs> tell about a certain thing that laid up a patient for two or three weeks and threatened to make him lose a finger.</seg> So the boy eagerly drew his sore toe from under the sheet and held it up for inspection. But now he did not know the necessary symptoms. However, it seemed well worth while to chance it, so he fell to groaning with considerable spirit.</p>
                    <p>But
                        <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_sid">Sid</rs> slept on unconscious.</p>

                        <seg xml:id="th_193" type="#childhood">Tom groaned louder, and fancied that he began to feel pain in the toe.</seg>
                    </p>
                    <p>No result from Sid.</p>
                    <p> Tom was panting with his exertions by this time. He took a rest and then swelled himself up and fetched a succession of admirable groans. </p>
                    <p>Sid snored on.</p>
                    <p>Tom was aggravated. He said,
                        <said who="#c_tom">“Sid, Sid!”</said> and shook him. This course worked well, and Tom began to groan again. Sid yawned, stretched, then brought himself up on his elbow with a snort, and began to stare at Tom. Tom went on groaning. Sid said:</p>
                    <p>
                        <said who="#c_sid">“Tom! Say, Tom!”</said> [No response.]

                    <p>THE harder Tom tried to fasten his mind on his book, the more his ideas wandered. So at last, with a sigh and a yawn, he gave it up. It seemed to him that the noon recess would never come. The air was utterly dead. There was not a breath stirring. It was the sleepiest of sleepy days. The drowsing murmur of the five and twenty studying scholars soothed the soul like the spell that is in the murmur of bees.  <seg xml:id="th_291" type="#mark_twain">Away off in the flaming sunshine, Cardiff Hill lifted its soft green sides through a shimmering veil of heat, tinted with the purple of distance; a few birds floated on lazy wing high in the air; no other living thing was visible but some cows, and they were asleep.</seg>  Tom’s heart ached to be free, or else to have something of interest <pb n="73" facs="media/pages/p73.jpg"/>to do to pass the dreary time. His hand wandered into his pocket and his face lit up with a glow of gratitude that was prayer, though he did not know it. Then furtively the <rs type="obRef" ref="#ob_cap_box">percussion-cap box</rs> came out. He released the <rs type="obRef" ref="#ob_tick" rendition="inScene">tick</rs> and put him on the long flat desk. The creature probably glowed with a gratitude that amounted to prayer, too, at this moment, but it was premature: for when he started thankfully to travel off, Tom turned him aside with a pin and made him take a new direction.  </p>

While one boy was worrying the tick with absorbing interest, the other would look on with interest as strong, the two heads bowed together over the <rs type="obRef" ref="#ob_slate #c_tom">slate</rs>, and the two souls dead to all things else. At last luck seemed to settle and abide with Joe. The tick tried this, that, and the other course, and got as excited and as anxious as the boys themselves, but time and again just as he would have victory in his very grasp, so to speak, and Tom’s fingers would be twitching to begin, Joe’s pin would deftly head him off, and keep possession. At last Tom could stand it no longer. The temptation was too strong. So he reached out and lent a hand with his pin. Joe was angry in a moment. </seg> Said he:</p>

No — better still, he would join the Indians, and hunt buffaloes and go on the warpath in the mountain ranges and the trackless great plains of the Far West, and away in the future come back a great chief, bristling with feathers, hideous with paint, and prance into Sunday-school, some drowsy summer morning, with a blood-curdling war-whoop, and sear the eyeballs of all his companions with unappeasable envy. But no, there was something gaudier even than this. He would be a pirate! That was it! <emph>Now</emph> his future lay plain before him, and glowing with unimaginable splendor. How his name would fill the world, and make people shudder! How gloriously he would go plowing the dancing seas, in his long, low, black-hulled racer, the Spirit of the Storm, with his grisly flag <pb n="81" facs="media/pages/p81.jpg"/>flying at the fore! And at the zenith of his fame, how he would suddenly appear at the old village and stalk into church, brown and weather-beaten, in his black velvet doublet and trunks, his great jack-boots, his crimson sash, his belt bristling with horse-pistols, his crime-rusted cutlass at his side, his slouch hat with waving plumes, his black flag unfurled, with the skull and crossbones on it, and hear with swelling ecstasy the whisperings, “It’s Tom Sawyer the Pirate! — the Black Avenger of the Spanish Main!”</seg>

                    <p>Yes, it was settled; his career was determined. He would run away from home and enter upon it. He would start the very next morning. Therefore he must now begin to get ready. He would collect his resources together.  He went to a rotten log near at hand and began to dig under one end of it with his <rs type="obRef" ref="#ob_barlow_knife" rendition="inScene">Barlow knife</rs>.

He scratched his head with a perplexed air, and said: </seg>

If you buried a marble with certain necessary incantations, and left it alone a fortnight, and then opened the place with the incantation he had just used, you would find that all the marbles you had ever lost had gathered themselves together there, meantime, no matter how widely they had been separated. </seg>But now, this thing had actually and unquestionably failed. <seg xml:id="th_373" type="#ethics">Tom’s whole structure of faith was shaken to its foundations.</seg> He had many a time heard of this thing succeeding but never of its failing before.

They said their prayers, and Sid was soon asleep. Tom lay awake and waited, in restless impatience. When it seemed to him that it must be nearly daylight, he heard the clock strike <time when="22:00:00">ten</time>! This was despair. He would have tossed and fidgeted, as his nerves demanded, but he was afraid he might wake Sid. So he lay still, and stared up into the dark. Everything was dismally still. By and by, out of the stillness, little, scarcely preceptible noises began to emphasize themselves. The ticking of the clock began to bring itself into notice. Old beams began to crack mysteriously. The stairs creaked faintly. Evidently spirits were abroad. A measured, muffled snore issued from Aunt Polly’s chamber. And now the <pb n="86" facs="media/pages/p86.jpg"/>tiresome chirping of a cricket that no human ingenuity could locate, began. <seg xml:id="th_417" type="#superstition">Next the ghastly ticking of a death-watch in the wall at the bed’s head made Tom shudder — it meant that somebody’s days were numbered.</seg> Then the howl of a far-off dog rose on the night air, and was answered by a fainter howl from a remoter distance. Tom was in an agony. At last he was satisfied that time had ceased and eternity begun; he began to doze, in spite of himself; the clock chimed eleven, but he did not hear it. And then there came, mingling with his half-formed dreams, a most melancholy caterwauling. The raising of a neighboring window disturbed him. A cry of “Scat! you devil!” and the crash of an empty bottle against the back of his aunt’s woodshed brought him wide awake, and a single minute later he was dressed and out of the window and creeping along the roof of the “ell” on all fours. He “meow’d” with caution once or twice, as he went; then jumped to the roof of the woodshed and thence to the ground.  <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_huck" rendition="inScene">Huckleberry Finn</rs> was there, with his dead cat. The boys moved off and disappeared in the gloom. At the end of half an hour they were wading through the tall grass of the graveyard.</p>

                    <p>It was a graveyard of the old-fashioned Western kind. It was on a hill, about a mile and a half from the village. It had a crazy board fence around it, which leaned inward in places, and outward the rest of the time, but stood upright nowhere. Grass and weeds grew rank over the whole cemetery. All the old graves were sunken in, there was not a tombstone on the place; round-topped, worm-eaten boards staggered over the graves, leaning for support and finding none. “Sacred to the memory of” So-and-So had been painted on them once, but it
                        <pb n="87" facs="media/pages/p87.jpg" />could no longer have been read, on the most of them, now, even if there had been light.</p>

                    <p>Then they waited in silence for what seemed a long time. The hooting of a distant owl was all the sound that troubled the dead stillness. Tom’s reflections grew oppressive. He must force some talk. So he said in a whisper:</p>

The man moaned, writhed a little, and his face came into the moonlight. It was Muff Potter. The boys' hearts had stood still, and their hopes too, when the man moved, but their fears passed away now. They tiptoed out, through the broken weather-boarding, and stopped at a little distance to exchange a parting word. <seg xml:id="th_493" type="#superstition">That long, lugubrious howl rose on the night air again!

                    <p>When Tom awoke, Sid was dressed and gone. There was a late look in the light, a late sense in the atmosphere. He was startled. Why had he not been called — persecuted till he was up, as usual? The thought filled him with bodings. Within five minutes he was dressed and down-stairs, feeling sore and drowsy. The family were still at table, but they had finished breakfast. There was no voice of rebuke; but there were averted eyes; there was a silence and an air of solemnity that struck a chill to the culprit’s heart. He sat down and tried to seem gay, but it was up-hill work; it roused no smile, no response, and he lapsed into silence and let his heart sink down to the depths.</p>
                    <p>After breakfast his aunt took him aside, and Tom almost brightened in the hope that he was going to be flogged; but it was not so.  <seg xml:id="th_500" type="#ethics">His aunt wept over him and asked him how he could go and break her old heart so; and finally told him to go on, and ruin himself and bring her gray hairs with sorrow to the grave, for it was no use for her to try any more. This was worse than a thousand whippings, and Tom’s heart was sorer now than his body. He cried, he pleaded for forgiveness, promised to reform over and over again, and then received his dismissal, feeling that he had won but an imperfect forgiveness and established but a feeble confidence.</seg>

            <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_polly" rendition="inScene">His aunt</rs> was concerned. She began to try all manner of remedies <pb n="108" facs="media/pages/p108.jpg"/>on him.

All the “rot” they contained about ventilation, and how to go to bed, and how to get up, and what to eat, and what to drink, and how much exercise to take, and what frame of mind to keep one’s self in, and what sort of clothing to wear, was all gospel to her, and she never observed that her health-journals of the current month customarily upset everything they <note type="comment">interesting cultural comment concerning the culture around the health industry and its marketing at this era</note>had recommended the month before.

                            <rs type="emotionsRef" ref="#c_tom">gloomy</rs> and
                            <rs type="emotionsRef" ref="#c_tom">desperate</rs>. He was a forsaken, friendless boy, he said; nobody loved him; when they found out what they had driven him to, perhaps they would be sorry; he had tried to do right and get along, but they would not let him; since nothing would do them but to be rid of him, let it be so; and let them blame
                            <emph>him</emph> for the consequences — why shouldn’t they? What right had the friendless to complain? Yes, they had forced him to it at last: he would lead a life of crime. There was no choice</seg>.</p>
                    <p>By this time he was far down
                        <rs type="placeRef" ref="#pl_meadow_lane" rendition="inScene">Meadow Lane</rs>, and the
                        <rs type="obRef" ref="#ob_school_bell" rendition="inScene">bell for school</rs> to “take up” tinkled faintly upon his ear. He sobbed, now, to think he should never, never hear that old familiar
                        <pb n="114" facs="media/pages/p114.jpg" />sound any more — it was very hard, but it was forced on him; since he was driven out into the cold world, he must submit — but he forgave them. Then the sobs came thick and fast.</p>
                    <p>Just at this point he met
                        <rs type="persTrait" ref="#c_joe_harper" corresp="#c_tom">his soul’s sworn comrade</rs>,
                        <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_joe_harper" rendition="inScene">Joe Harper</rs> — hard-eyed, and with evidently a great and dismal purpose in his heart. Plainly here were “two souls with but a single thought.”
                        <seg xml:id="th_539" type="#childhood">Tom, wiping his eyes with his sleeve, began to blubber out something about a resolution to escape from hard usage and lack of sympathy at home by roaming abroad into the great world never to return; <note type="comment">boys full of sentiments of rejection want to escape their social surrounding and flee home</note>and ended by hoping that Joe would not forget him.</seg>
                    </p>
                    <p>But it transpired that this was a request which Joe had just been going to make of Tom, and had come to hunt him up for that purpose. His mother had whipped him for drinking some cream which he had never tasted and knew nothing about; it was plain that she was tired of him and wished him to go; if she felt that way, there was nothing for him to do but succumb; he hoped she would be happy, and never regret having driven her poor boy out into the unfeeling world to suffer and die.</p>
                    <p>As the two boys walked sorrowing along, they made a new compact to stand by each other and be brothers and never separate till death relieved them of their troubles. <seg xml:id="th_540" type="#myth">Then they began to lay their plans. Joe was for being a hermit, and living on crusts in a remote cave, and dying, some time, of cold and want and grief; but after listening to Tom, he conceded that there were some conspicuous advantages about a life of crime, and so he consented to be a pirate.</seg>

                    <p>Three miles below St. Petersburg, at a point where the Mississippi River was a trifle over a mile wide, there was a long, narrow, wooded island, with a shallow bar at the head of it, and this offered well as a rendezvous. It was not inhabited; it lay far over toward the further shore, abreast a dense and almost wholly unpeopled forest. So

Each would bring hooks and lines, and such provision as he could steal in the most dark and mysterious way — as became outlaws. And before the afternoon was done, they had all managed to enjoy the sweet glory of spreading the fact that pretty soon the town would “hear something.” All who got this vague hint were cautioned to “

They saw a fire smouldering upon a great raft a hundred yards above, and they went stealthily thither and helped themselves to a chunk. <pb n="116" facs="media/pages/p116.jpg"/>They made an imposing adventure of it, saying, “Hist!” every now and then, and suddenly halting with finger on lip; moving with hands on imaginary dagger-hilts; and giving orders in dismal whispers that if “the foe” stirred, to “let him have it to the hilt,” because “dead men tell no tales.” They knew well enough that <seg xml:id="th_547" type="#community">the raftsmen were all down at the village laying in stores or having a spree</seg>, but still that was no excuse for their conducting this thing in an unpiratical way.</seg>

The other pirates were looking their last, too; and they all looked so long that they came near letting the current drift them out of the range of the island.

                            <seg xml:id="th_561" type="#superstition">in truth, they had a mind not to say them at all, but they were afraid to proceed to such lengths as that, lest they might call down a sudden and special thunderbolt from heaven. Then at once they reached and hovered upon the imminent verge of sleep — but an intruder came, now, that would not “down.” It was conscience. </seg>They began to feel a vague fear that they had been doing wrong to run away; and next they thought of the stolen meat, and then the real torture came. They tried to argue it away by reminding conscience that they had purloined sweetmeats and apples scores of times; but conscience was not to be appeased by such thin plausibilities; it seemed to them, in the end, that there was no getting around the stubborn fact that taking sweetmeats was only “hooking,” while taking bacon and hams and such valuables was plain simple stealing — and there was a command against that in the Bible. So they inwardly resolved that so long as they remained in the business, their piracies should not again be sullied with the crime of stealing. Then conscience granted a truce, and these curiously inconsistent pirates fell peacefully to sleep.</seg>

                        <date>dawn</date>, and there was a delicious sense of repose and peace in the deep pervading calm and silence of the woods. Not a leaf stirred; not a sound obtruded upon great Nature’s meditation. Beaded dewdrops stood upon the leaves and grasses. A white layer of ashes covered the fire, and a thin blue breath of smoke rose straight into the air.
                        <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_joe_harper" rendition="inScene">Joe</rs> and

                        <pb n="122" facs="media/pages/p122.jpg" />sleep and going to work unfolded itself to the musing boy. A

                        <seg xml:id="th_562" type="#superstition">and when at last it considered a painful moment with its curved body in the air and then came decisively down upon Tom’s leg and began a journey over him, his whole heart was glad — for that meant that he was going to have a new suit of clothes — without the shadow of a doubt a gaudy piratical uniform. </seg>Now a procession of

Before the depth reached his middle he was half-way over; the current would permit no more wading, now, so he struck out confidently to swim the remaining hundred yards. He swam quartering upstream, but still was swept downward rather faster than he had expected. However, he reached the shore finally, and drifted along till he found a low place and drew himself out. He put his hand on his jacket pocket, found his piece of <rs type="obRef" ref="#ob_sycamorebark" rendition="inScene">bark</rs> safe, and then struck through the woods, following the shore, with streaming garments.</seg> Shortly <pb n="129" facs="media/pages/p129.jpg"/>

                    <p>Presently the cracked bell tapped and a voice gave the order to “cast off.” A minute or two later the skiff’s head was standing high up, against the boat’s swell, and the voyage was begun. Tom felt happy in his success, for he knew it was the boat’s last trip for the night. At the end of a long twelve or fifteen minutes the wheels stopped, andTom slipped overboard and swam ashore in the dusk, landing fifty yards downstream, out of danger of possible stragglers.</p>

It was believed that the search for the bodies had been a fruitless effort merely because the drowning must have occurred in mid-channel, since the boys, being good swimmers, would otherwise have escaped to shore.

When he had pulled a mile above the village, he started quartering across and bent himself stoutly to his work.

                        <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_joe_harper" rendition="inScene">Joe</rs> awoke, and called
                        <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom #c_huck" rendition="inScene">the boys</rs>. There was a brooding oppressiveness in the air that seemed to bode something. The boys huddled themselves together and sought the friendly companionship of the fire, though the dull dead heat of the breathless atmosphere was stifling. They sat still, intent and waiting. The solemn hush continued. Beyond the light of the fire everything was swallowed up in the blackness of darkness. Presently there came a quivering glow that vaguely revealed the foliage for a moment and then vanished. By and by another came, a little stronger. Then another.
                        <seg xml:id="th_616" type="#superstition">Then a faint moan came sighing through the branches of the forest and the boys felt a fleeting breath upon their cheeks, and shuddered with the fancy that the Spirit of the Night had gone by.</seg> There was a pause. Now a weird flash turned night into day and showed every little grass-blade, separate and distinct, that grew about their feet. And it showed three white, startled faces, too. A deep peal of thunder went rolling and tumbling down the heavens and lost itself in sullen rumblings in the distance. A sweep of chilly air passed by, rustling all the leaves and snowing the flaky ashes broadcast about the fire. Another fierce glare lit up the forest and an instant crash followed that seemed to rend the tree-tops right over the boys’ heads. They clung together in terror, in the thick gloom that followed. A few big rain-drops fell pattering upon the leaves.</p>
                    <p>“
                        <said who="#c_tom">Quick! boys, go for the
                            <rs type="obRef" ref="#ob_tent" rendition="inScene">tent</rs>!</said>” exclaimed Tom.</p>
                    <p>They sprang away, stumbling over roots and among
                        <rs type="oRef" ref="#ob_flora" rendition="inScene">vines</rs> in the dark, no two plunging in the same direction. A furious blast roared through the trees, making everything sing as it went. One blinding flash after another came, and peal on peal of deafening thunder. And now a drenching rain poured down and the rising hurricane drove it in sheets along the ground. The boys cried out to each
                        <pb n="141" facs="media/pages/p141.jpg" />other, but the roaring wind and the booming thunder-blasts drowned their voices utterly. However, one by one they straggled in at last and took shelter under the
                        <rs type="obRef" ref="#ob_tent" rendition="inScene">tent</rs>, cold, scared, and streaming with water; but to have company in misery seemed something to be grateful for. They could not talk,
                        <rs type="obTrait" ref="#ob_tent">the old sail</rs> flapped so furiously, even if the other noises would have allowed them. The tempest rose higher and higher, and presently
                        <rs type="obRef" ref="#ob_tent" rendition="inScene">the sail</rs> tore loose from its fastenings and went winging away on the blast. The boys seized each others' hands and fled, with many tumblings and bruises, to the shelter of a great oak that stood upon the river-bank. Now the battle was at its highest. Under the ceaseless conflagration of lightning that flamed in the skies, everything below stood out in clean-cut and shadowless distinctness: the bending trees, the billowy river, white with foam, the driving spray of spume-flakes, the dim outlines of the high bluffs on the other side, glimpsed through the drifting cloud-rack and the slanting veil of rain.Every little while some giant tree yielded the fight and fell crashing through the younger growth; and the unflagging thunder-peals came now in ear-splitting explosive bursts, keen and sharp, and unspeakably
                        <pb n="142" facs="media/pages/p142.jpg" />appalling. The storm culminated in one matchless effort that seemed likely to tear the island to pieces, burn it up, drown it to the tree-tops, blow it away, and deafen every creature in it, all at one and the same moment. It was a wild night for homeless young heads to be out in.</p>

                    <p>But at last the battle was done, and the forces retired with weaker and weaker threatenings and grumblings, and peace resumed her sway. The boys went back to camp, a good deal awed; but they found there was still something to be thankful for, because the great sycamore, the shelter of their beds, was a ruin, now, blasted by the lightnings, and they were not under it when the catastrophe happened.</p>
                    <p>Everything in camp was drenched, the camp-fire as well; <seg xml:id="th_617" type="#mark_twain">for they were but heedless lads, like their generation, and had made no provision against rain.</seg> Here was matter for dismay, for they were soaked through and chilled. They were eloquent in their distress; but they presently discovered that the fire had eaten so far up under the great log it had been built against (where it curved upward and separated itself from the ground), that a handbreadth or so of it had escaped wetting; so they patiently wrought until, with shreds and bark gathered from the under sides of sheltered logs, they coaxed the fire to burn again. Then they piled on great dead boughs till they had a roaring furnace, and were glad-hearted once more. They dried their <rs type="obRef" subtype="food" ref="#ob_boiled_ham" rendition="inScene">boiled ham</rs> and had a feast, and after that they sat by the fire and expanded and glorified their midnight adventure until morning, for there was not a dry spot to sleep on, anywhere around. </p>

After the meal they felt rusty, and stiff-jointed, and a little home-sick once more. Tom saw the signs, and fell to cheering up the pirates as well as he could.

He reminded them of the imposing secret, and raised a ray of cheer. While it lasted, he got them interested in a new device. This was to knock off being pirates, for a while, and be Indians for a change. They were attracted by this idea; so it was not long before they were stripped, and striped from head to heel with black mud, like so many zebras — all of them chiefs, of course — and then they went tearing through the woods to attack an English settlement</seg>.</p>

Now that he was distinguished, maybe she would be wanting to “make up.” Well, let her — she should see that he could be as indifferent as some other people.</seg> Presently she arrived. Tom pretended not to see her. He moved away and joined a group of boys and girls and began to talk. Soon he observed that she was tripping gayly back and forth with flushed face and dancing eyes, pretending to be busy chasing schoolmates, and screaming with laughter when she made a capture;but he noticed that she always made her captures in his vicinity, and that she seemed to cast a conscious eye in his direction at such times, too. It gratified all the vicious vanity that was in him; and so, instead of winning him, it only “set him up” the more and made him the more diligent to avoid betraying that he knew she was about. Presently she gave over skylarking, and moved irresolutely about, sighing once or twice and glancing furtively and wistfully toward Tom. Then she observed that now Tom was talking more particularly to

            <date>At recess</date> Tom continued his flirtation with Amy with jubilant self-satisfaction. And he kept drifting about to find Becky and lacerate her with the performance. At last he spied her, but there was a sudden falling of his mercury. She was sitting cosily on a little bench behind the schoolhouse looking at <rs type="obRef" ref="#ob_beckys_book #c_becky" rendition="inScene">a picture-book</rs> with <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_alfred_temple" rendition="inScene">Alfred Temple </rs>— and so absorbed were they, and their heads so close together over the book, that they did not seem to be conscious of anything in the world besides. <seg xml:id="th_665" type="#ethics">Jealousy ran red-hot through Tom’s veins. He began to hate himself for throwing away the chance Becky had offered for a reconciliation. He called himself a fool, and all the hard names he could think of. He wanted to cry with vexation.</seg> Amy chatted happily along, as they walked, for her heart was singing, but Tom’s tongue had lost its function. He did not hear what Amy was saying, and whenever she paused expectantly he could only stammer an awkward assent, which was as often misplaced as otherwise. He kept drifting to the rear of the school-house, again and again, to sear his eyeballs with the hateful spectacle there. He could not help it. And it maddened him to see, as he thought he saw, that Becky Thatcher never once suspected that he was even in the land of the living. But she did see, nevertheless; <seg xml:id="th_666" type="#ethics">and she knew she was winning her fight, too, and was glad to see him suffer as she had suffered.</seg>

                    <p> THERE was something about Aunt Polly’s manner, when she kissed Tom, that swept away his low spirits and made him light-hearted and happy again.

Presently the <rs type="obRef" ref="#ob_spelling_book #c_tom" rendition="inScene">spelling-book</rs> discovery was made, and Tom’s mind was entirely full of his own matters for a while after that. Becky roused up from her lethargy of distress and showed good interest in the proceedings. She did not expect that Tom could get out of his trouble by denying that he spilt the ink on the book himself; and she was right. The denial only seemed to make the thing worse for Tom. Becky supposed she would be glad of that, and she tried to believe she was glad of it, but she found she was not certain. <seg xml:id="th_693" type="#ethics"> When the worst came to the worst, she had an impulse to get up and tell on Alfred Temple, but she made an effort and forced herself to keep still — because, said she to herself, “he’ll tell about me tearing the picture sure.

        </p>
                    <p>Tom took his whipping and went back to his seat not at all broken-hearted, for he thought it was possible that he had unknowingly upset the ink on the spelling-book himself, in some skylarking bout —

                        <rs type="obTrait" ref="#ob_schoolmasters_desk">in his throne</rs>, the air was drowsy with the hum of study. By and by, Mr. Dobbins straightened himself up, yawned, then unlocked his desk, and reached for his book, but seemed undecided whether to take it out or leave it. Most of the pupils glanced up languidly, but there were two among them that watched his movements with intent eyes. Mr. Dobbins fingered his book absently for a while, then took it out and settled himself in his chair to read! Tom shot a glance at Becky.
                        <seg xml:id="th_697" type="#ethics">He had seen a hunted and helpless rabbit look as she did, with a gun levelled at its head. Instantly he forgot his quarrel with her.</seg> Quick — something must be done! done in a flash, too! But the very imminence of the emergency paralyzed his invention. Good! — he had an inspiration! He would run and snatch the book, spring through the door and fly. But his resolution shook for one little instant, and the chance was lost — the master opened the volume. If Tom only had the wasted opportunity back again! Too late. There was no help for Becky now, he said.
                        <seg xml:id="th_698" type="#community">The next moment the master faced the school. Every eye sank under his gaze. There was that in it which smote even the innocent with fear. There was silence
                            <time>while one might count ten</time> — the master was gathering his wrath. Then he spoke:

Then there were reading exercises, and a spelling fight. The meagre Latin class recited with honor. </seg><seg xml:id="th_715" type="#gender">The prime feature of the evening was in order, now — original “compositions” by the young ladies. Each in her turn stepped forward to the edge of the platform, cleared her throat, held up her manuscript (tied with dainty ribbon), and proceeded to read, with labored attention to “expression” and punctuation. The themes were the same that had been illuminated upon similar occasions by their mothers before them, their grandmothers, and doubtless all their ancestors in the female line clear back to the Crusades. “Friendship” was one; “Memories of Other Days”; “Religion in History”; “Dream Land”; “The Advantages of Culture”; “Forms of Political Government Compared and <pb n="171" facs="media/pages/p171.jpg"/>Contrasted”; “Melancholy”; “Filial Love”; “Heart Longings,” etc., etc.</seg>

                <seg xml:id="th_717" type="#mark_twain">A prevalent feature in these compositions was a nursed and petted melancholy; another was a wasteful and opulent gush of “fine language”; another was a tendency to lug in by the ears particularly prized words and phrases until they were worn entirely out; and a peculiarity that conspicuously marked and marred them was the inveterate and intolerable sermon that wagged its crippled tail at the end of each and every one of them. No matter what the subject might be, a brain-racking effort was made to squirm it into some aspect or other that the moral and religious mind could contemplate with edification. The glaring insincerity of these sermons was not sufficient to compass the banishment of the fashion from the schools, and it is not sufficient to-day; it never will be sufficient while the world stands, perhaps. <seg xml:id="th_719" type="#gender">There is no school in all our land where the young ladies do not feel obliged to close their compositions with a sermon; and you will find that the sermon of the most frivolous and the least religious girl in the school is always the longest and the most relentlessly pious.</seg> But enough of this. Homely truth is unpalatable.</seg>
            </seg>
        </p>
                    <p>Let us return to the “Examination.” The first composition that was read was one entitled “Is this, then, Life?”
                        <seg xml:id="th_720" type="#mark_twain">Perhaps the reader can endure an extract from it:</seg>
                    </p>
                    <p>“
                        <said who="#c_nameless_girl">In the common walks of life, with what delightful emotions does the youthful mind look forward to some anticipated scene of festivity! Imagination is busy sketching rose-tinted pictures of joy. In fancy, the voluptuous votary of fashion sees herself amid the festive throng, ‘the observed of all observers.’ Her graceful form, arrayed in snowy robes, is whirling through the mazes of the joyous dance; her eye is brightest, her step is lightest in the gay assembly.</said>
                    </p>
                    <p>“
                        <said who="#c_nameless_girl">In such delicious fancies time quickly glides by, and the welcome hour arrives for her entrance into the Elysian world, of which she has had such bright dreams. How fairy-like does everything appear to her enchanted vision! Each new scene is more charming than the last. But after a while she finds that beneath this goodly exterior, all is vanity, the flattery which once charmed her soul, now grates harshly upon her ear; the ball-room has lost its charms; and with wasted health and imbittered heart, she turns away with the conviction that earthly pleasures cannot satisfy the longings of the soul!</said>”</p>
                    <p>
                        <seg xml:id="th_721" type="#community">And so forth and so on. There was a buzz of gratification from time to time during the reading, accompanied by whispered ejaculations of “

                            <l>Dark and tempestuous was night.

Even the boisterous winds unanimously came forth from their mystic homes, and blustered about as if to enhance by their aid the wildness of the scene.</l>

So soft was her step, it failed to make even a sound, and but for the magical thrill imparted by her genial touch, as other unobtrusive beauties, she would have glided away un-perceived — unsought. A strange sadness rested upon her features, like icy tears upon the robe of December, as she pointed to the contending elements without, and bade me contemplate the two beings presented.</l>

But he made a sad business of it with his unsteady hand, and a smothered titter rippled over the house. He knew what the matter was, and set himself to right it. He sponged out lines and remade them; but he only distorted them more than ever, and the tittering was more pronounced. He threw his entire attention upon his work, now, as if determined not to be put down by the mirth. He felt that all eyes were fastened upon him; he imagined he was succeeding, and yet the tittering continued; it even manifestly increased. And well it might.

                        <p>Tom joins the Cadets of Temperance so he can wear the red sash and fancy costume. The group must swear to stop cursing, drinking, gambling and any other "bad" vice. Tom can't handle this so he resolves to hang on until Judge Frazier, the justice of the peace, dies, because then he can wear his red sash in the public funeral. When the judge recovers, Tom resigns from the Cadets. The judge suffers a relapse and dies that night.</p>

They saw a <rs type="placeTrait" ref="#pl_haunted_house">weed-grown, floorless room, unplastered, an ancient fireplace, vacant windows, a ruinous staircase; and here, there, and everywhere hung ragged and abandoned cobwebs</rs>.

                    <p>The two men got out some food and made a luncheon. After a long and thoughtful silence, Injun Joe said:</p>

We’ll leg it together!”</said>
                    </p>
                    <p>This was satisfactory. Both men presently fell to yawning, and Injun Joe said:</p>

                    <p>He curled down in the weeds and soon began to snore. His comrade stirred him once or twice and he became quiet. Presently the watcher began to nod; his head drooped lower and lower, both men began to snore now.</p>
                    <p>The boys drew a long, grateful breath. Tom whispered:</p>

But the first step he made wrung such a hideous creak from the crazy floor that he sank down almost dead with fright. He never made a second attempt.

                    </p>
                    <p>The boys’ breath forsook them. Injun Joe put his hand on his knife, halted a moment, undecided, and then turned toward the stairway. The boys thought of the closet, but their strength was gone. The steps came creaking up the stairs — the intolerable distress of the situation woke the stricken resolution of the lads — they were about to spring for the closet, when there was a crash of rotten timbers and Injun Joe landed on the ground amid the debris of the ruined stairway. He gathered himself up cursing, and his comrade said:</p>
                    <p>
            <said who="#c_ragged_man">“Now what’s the use of all that? If it’s anybody, and they’re up there, let them <emph>stay</emph> there — who cares? If they want to jump down, now, and get into trouble, who objects? It will be dark in fifteen minutes — and then let them follow us if they want to. I’m willing. In my opinion, whoever hove those things in here caught a sight of us and took us for ghosts or devils or something. I’ll bet they’re running yet.” </said>

He would have hidden the silver with the gold to wait there till his “revenge” was satisfied, and then he would have had the misfortune to find that money turn up missing.

                    <p>They resolved to keep a lookout for that Spaniard when he should come to town spying out for chances to do his revengeful job, and follow him to “Number Two,” wherever that might be. Then a ghastly thought occurred to Tom.</p>

                    <p> THE adventure of the day mightily tormented Tom’s dreams <time when-custom="Saturday to Sunday, night">that night</time>. Four times he had his hands on that rich treasure and four times it wasted to nothingness in his fingers as sleep forsook him and wakefulness brought back the hard reality of his misfortune.  As he lay in the <time when-custom="Sunday, early morning">early morning</time> recalling the incidents of his great adventure, he noticed that they seemed curiously subdued and far away — somewhat as if they had happened in another world, or in a time long gone by. <seg ana="#superstition">Then it occurred to him that the great adventure itself must be a dream!</seg>
            <seg xml:id="th_862" type="#childhood">There was one very strong argument in favor of this idea — namely, that the quantity of coin he had seen was too vast to be real. He had never seen as much as fifty dollars in one mass before, and he was like all boys of <pb n="209" facs="media/pages/p209.jpg"/>his age and station in life, in that he imagined that all references to “hundreds” and “thousands” were mere fanciful forms of speech, and that no such sums really existed in the world. He never had supposed for a moment that so large a sum as a hundred dollars was to be found in actual money in any one’s possession. If his notions of hidden treasure had been analyzed, they would have been found to consist of a handful of real dimes and a bushel of vague, splendid, ungraspable dollars.</seg>

                    <p>But the incidents of his adventure grew sensibly sharper and clearer under the attrition of thinking them over, and so he presently found himself leaning to the impression that the thing might not have been a dream, after all. This uncertainty must be swept away. He would snatch a hurried breakfast and go and find Huck. Huck was sitting on the gunwale of a flatboat, listlessly dangling his feet in the water and looking very melancholy. Tom concluded to let Huck lead up to the subject. If he did not do it, then the adventure would be proved to have been only a dream.</p>

The thought took a deal of the spirit out of his anticipations. Still he could not bear to give up the fun at Widow Douglas'.

The crowd swarmed ashore and soon the forest distances and craggy heights echoed far and near with shoutings and laughter. All the different ways of getting hot and tired were gone through with, and by-and-by the rovers straggled back to camp fortified with responsible appetites, and then the destruction of the good things began. <date when-custom="Saturday - sometime after lunch time">After the feast</date> there was a refreshing season of rest and chat in the shade of spreading oaks. By-and-by somebody shouted:</p>
                    <p>

                    </p>
                    <p>Everybody was. Bundles of candles were procured, and straightway there was a general scamper up the hill. The <rs type="placeRef" ref="#pl_cave">mouth of the cave was up the hillside</rs> — an opening shaped like a letter A. <rs type="placeTrait" n="for main cave entrance" ref="#pl_cave">Its massive oaken door stood unbarred</rs>. <rs type="placeRef" n="Cave, first small chamber" ref="#pl_cave">Within was a small chamber</rs>, chilly as an ice-house, and walled by Nature with solid limestone that was dewy with a cold sweat. <rs type="placeTrait" n="for first small chamber" ref="#pl_cave">It was romantic and mysterious to stand here in the deep gloom and look out upon the green valley shining in the sun.</rs> But the impressiveness of the situation quickly wore off, and the romping began again. The moment a candle was lighted there was a general rush upon the owner of it; a struggle and a gallant defence followed, but the candle was soon knocked down or blown out, and then there was a glad clamor of laughter and a new chase. But all things have an end. By-and-by the procession went filing down the steep descent of the main avenue, the flickering rank of lights dimly revealing the lofty walls of rock almost to their point of junction sixty feet overhead. This main avenue was not more than eight or ten feet wide. Every few steps other lofty and still narrower crevices branched from it on either hand <pb n="220" facs="media/pages/p220.jpg"/>— for McDougal’s cave was but a vast labyrinth of crooked aisles that ran into each other and out again and led nowhere. <seg xml:id="th_899" type="#myth">It was said that one might wander days and nights together through its intricate tangle of rifts and chasms, and never find the end of the cave; and that he might go down, and down, and still down, into the earth, and it was just the same — labyrinth under labyrinth, and no end to any of them. <rs type="placeTrait" ref="#pl_cave">No man “knew” the cave.</rs> That was an impossible thing. Most of the young men knew a portion of it, and it was not customary to venture much beyond this known portion. </seg>Tom Sawyer knew as much of the cave as any one.</p>

They went straight ahead, then, until they came to the path that led up Cardiff Hill; this they took. They passed by the old Welshman’s house, half-way up the hill, without hesitating, and still climbed upward. Good, thought Huck, they will bury it in the old quarry. But they never stopped at the quarry. They passed on, up the summit. They plunged into the narrow path between the tall sumach bushes, and were at once hidden in the gloom. Huck closed up and shortened his distance, now, for they would never be able to see him. He trotted along awhile; then slackened his pace, fearing he was gaining too fast; moved on a piece, then stopped altogether; listened; no sound; none, save that he seemed to hear the beating of his own heart.

He knew he was within five steps of the stile leading into Widow Douglas’s grounds. Very well, he thought, let them bury it there; it won’t be hard to find.</p>

                    <p>These thoughts worked their dim way through Huck’s mind, and under the weariness they gave him he fell asleep. The widow said to herself:</p>

They wound this way and that, far down into the secret depths of the cave, made another mark, and branched off in search of novelties to tell the upper world about. In one place they found a <rs type="placeRef" ref="#pl_cave">spacious cavern</rs>, from whose ceiling depended a multitude of shining stalactites of the length and circumference of a man’s leg; they walked all about it, wondering and admiring, and presently left it by one of the numerous passages that opened into it. This shortly brought them to <rs type="placeRef" ref="#pl_cave">a bewitching spring</rs>, whose basin was incrusted with a frostwork of glittering crystals; it was in the midst of a cavern whose walls were supported by many fantastic pillars which had been formed by the joining of great stalactites and stalagmites together, the result of the ceaseless water-drip of centuries. </p>

He sat down by her and put his arms around her; she buried her face in his bosom, she clung to him, she poured out her terrors, her unavailing regrets, and the far echoes turned them all to jeering laughter. Tom begged her to pluck up <rs type="emotionsRef" ref="#c_tom">hope</rs> again, and she said she could not. <seg xml:id="th_970" type="#ethics">He fell to blaming and abusing himself for getting her into this miserable situation; this had a better effect. <pb n="241" facs="media/pages/p241.jpg"/>She said she would try to hope again, she would get up and follow wherever he might lead if only he would not talk like that any more.

                    <p>By-and-by, fatigue began to assert its claims; the children tried to pay attention, for it was dreadful to think of sitting down when time was grown to be so precious, moving, in some direction, in any direction, was at least progress and might bear fruit; but to sit down was to invite death and shorten its pursuit.</p>
                    <p>At last Becky’s frail limbs refused to carry her farther. She sat down.
                        <seg xml:id="th_974" type="#ethics">Tom rested with her, and they talked of home, and the friends there, and the comfortable beds and, above all, the light!

While he was deep in his musings, Becky woke up with a breezy little laugh — but it was stricken dead upon her lips, and a groan followed it.</p>

They sat down, and Tom fastened his candle to the wall in front of them with some clay. Thought was soon busy; nothing was said for some time. Then Becky broke the silence:</p>

                        <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom">Tom’s</rs> arms, neither could tell. All that they knew was, that after what seemed a mighty stretch of time, both awoke out of a dead stupor of sleep and resumed their miseries once more. Tom said it might be
                        <date>Sunday, now — maybe Monday</date>. He tried to get Becky to talk, but her sorrows were
                        <pb n="244" facs="media/pages/p244.jpg" />too oppressive, all her hopes were gone. Tom said that they must have been missed long ago, and no doubt the search was going on. He would shout and maybe some one would come. He tried it; but in the darkness the distant echoes sounded so hideously that he tried it no more.</p>
                    <p>
                        <date>The hours</date> wasted away, and hunger came to torment the captives again. A portion of Tom’s half of the
                        <rs type="obRef" ref="#ob_wedding_cake" rendition="inScene">cake</rs> was left; they divided and ate it. But they seemed

                        </rs> than before. The poor morsel of food only whetted desire.</p>
                    <p>By-and-by Tom said:</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>Both held their breath and listened. There was a sound like the faintest, far-off shout. Instantly Tom answered it, and leading Becky by the hand, started groping down the corridor in its direction. Presently he listened again; again the sound was heard, and apparently a little nearer.</p>
                    <p>
                        <said who="#c_tom">“It’s them!”</said> said Tom; “they’re coming! Come along, Becky — we’re all right now!”</p>
                    <p>The joy of the prisoners was almost overwhelming. Their speed was slow, however, because pitfalls were somewhat common, and had to be guarded against. They shortly came to one and had to stop. It might be three feet deep, it might be a hundred — there was no passing it at any rate. Tom got down on his breast and reached as far down as he could. No bottom. They must stay there and wait until the searchers came. They listened; evidently the distant shoutings were growing more distant! a moment or two more and they had gone altogether. The heart-sinking misery of it! Tom whooped until he was hoarse, but it was of no use. He talked hopefully to Becky; but an age of anxious waiting passed and no sounds came again.</p>

                    <p>Now an idea struck him. There were some side passages near at hand. It would be better to explore some of these than bear the weight of the heavy time in idleness. <seg xml:id="th_981" type="#technique">He took a <rs type="obRef" ref="#ob_kiteline #c_tom">kite-line</rs> from his pocket, tied it to a projection, and he and Becky started, Tom in the lead, unwinding the line as he groped <pb n="245" facs="media/pages/p245.jpg"/>along. </seg>At the end of twenty steps the corridor ended in a “ jumping-off place.” <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_tom" rendition="inScene">Tom</rs> got down on his knees and felt below, and then as far around the corner as he could reach with his hands conveniently; he made an effort to stretch yet a little farther to the right, and at that moment, not twenty yards away, a human hand, holding a candle, appeared from behind a rock! Tom lifted up a glorious shout, and instantly that hand was followed by the body it belonged to — Injun Joe’s! Tom was paralyzed; he could not move. He was vastly gratified the next moment, to see the <rs type="persRef" ref="#c_injun_joe">“Spaniard”</rs> take to his heels and get himself out of sight. Tom wondered that Joe had not recognized his voice and come over and killed him for testifying in court. But the echoes must have disguised the voice. Without doubt, that was it, he reasoned. Tom’s <pb n="246" facs="media/pages/p246.jpg"/>fright weakened every muscle in his body. He said to himself that if he had strength enough to get back to the spring he would stay there, and nothing should tempt him to run the risk of meeting Injun Joe again. <seg ana="#ethics">He was careful to keep from Becky what it was he had seen. He told her he had only shouted “for luck.”</seg></p>

The great foundation-beam of the door had been chipped and hacked through, with tedious labor; useless labor, too, it was, for the native rock formed a sill outside it, and upon that stubborn material the knife had wrought no effect; the only damage done was to the knife itself. But if there had been no stony obstruction there the labor would have been useless still, for if the beam had been wholly cut away Injun Joe could not have squeezed his body under the door, and he knew it. So he had only hacked that place in order to be doing something — in order to pass the weary time — in order to employ his tortured faculties. Ordinarily one could find <measure quantity="6" unit="count">half a dozen</measure> bits of <rs type="obRef" ref="#ob_candle">candle</rs> stuck around in the crevices of this vestibule, left there by tourists; but there were none now.

Has everything a purpose and a mission? Did this drop fall patiently during five thousand years to be ready for this flitting human insect’s need? and has it another important object to accomplish ten thousand years to come? No matter. It is many and many a year since the hapless half-breed scooped out the stone to catch the priceless drops, but to this day the tourist stares longest at that pathetic stone and that slow-dropping water when he comes to see the wonders of <rs type="placeRef" ref="#pl_cave">McDougal’s cave.</rs></seg>

The widow’s servants kept him clean and neat, combed and brushed, and they bedded him nightly in unsympathetic sheets that had not one little spot or stain which he could press to his heart and know for a friend. He had to eat with a knife and
                            <pb n="270" facs="media/pages/p270.jpg" />fork; he had to use napkin, cup, and plate; he had to learn his book, he had to go to church; he had to talk so properly that speech was become insipid in his mouth; whithersoever he turned, the bars and shackles of civilization shut him in and bound him hand and foot.</seg>
