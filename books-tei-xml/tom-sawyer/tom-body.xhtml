And this would help him to understand why constructing artificial flowers or performing on a tread-mill is work, while rolling ten-pins or climbing Mont Blanc is only amusement. There are wealthy gentlemen in England who drive four-horse passenger-coaches twenty or thirty miles on a daily line, in the summer, because the privilege costs them considerable money; but if they were offered wages for the service, that would turn it into work and then they would resign.</span> </p>

Tom came up to the fence and leaned on it, grieving, and hoping she would tarry yet awhile longer. She halted a moment on the steps and then moved toward the door. Tom heaved a great sigh as she put her foot on the threshold. But his face lit up, right away, for she tossed a pansy over the fence a moment before she disappeared.</p>

But only for a minute — only while he could button the flower inside his jacket, next his heart — or next his stomach, possibly, for he was not much posted in anatomy, and not hypercritical, anyway.</p>

How she would throw herself upon him, and how her tears would fall like rain, and her lips pray God to give her back her boy and she would never, never abuse him any more! But he would lie there cold and white and make no sign — a poor little sufferer, whose griefs were at an end. </span>He so worked upon his feelings with the pathos of these dreams, that he had to keep swallowing, he was so like to choke; and his eyes swam in a blur of water, which overflowed when he winked, and ran down and trickled from the end of his nose. </span>And such a luxury to him was this petting of his sorrows, that he could not bear to have any worldly cheeriness or any grating delight intrude upon <span id="pb-505BC8BE-9274-41C3-A012-07852CD13C34" data-n="39" data-facs="media/pages/p39.jpg" data-was="pb"/>it; it was too sacred for such contact; and so, presently, when his <span data-type="persRef" data-ref="#c_mary" data-was="rs">cousin Mary</span> danced in, all alive with the joy of seeing home again after an age-long visit of one week to the country, he got up and moved in clouds and darkness out at one door as she brought song and sunshine in at the other.</p>

He entered the church, now, with a swarm of clean and noisy <span data-type="persRef" data-ref="#c_anonymous_kids" data-rendition="inScene" data-was="rs">boys and girls</span>, proceeded to his seat and started a quarrel with the first <span data-type="persRef" data-ref="#c_nameless_boy" data-rendition="inScene" data-was="rs">boy</span> that came handy.

Tom’s whole class were of a pattern — restless, noisy, and troublesome. When they came to recite their lessons, not one of them knew his verses perfectly, but had to be prompted all along. However, they worried through, and each got his reward — in small <span data-type="obRef" data-ref="#ob_ticket" data-rendition="inScene" data-was="rs">blue tickets </span>, each with a passage of Scripture on it; each blue ticket was pay for two verses of the recitation.

            <span id="th_131" data-type="#community" data-was="seg">Only the older pupils managed to keep their tickets and stick to their tedious work long enough to get a Bible, and so the delivery of one of these prizes was a rare and noteworthy circumstance; the successful pupil was so great and conspicuous for that day that on the spot every scholar’s heart was fired with a fresh ambition that often lasted a couple of weeks. <span id="th_132" data-type="#ethics" data-was="seg">It is possible that Tom’s mental stomach had never really hungered for one of those prizes, but unquestionably his entire being had for many a day longed for the glory and the eclat that came with it.</span>

Presently he bethought him of a treasure he had and got it out. It was a <span data-type="obTrait" data-ref="#ob_fauna" data-was="rs">large black beetle</span> with formidable jaws — <span data-resp="#ed_mao" data-was="orig">a “ <span data-type="obRef" data-subdata-type="fauna" data-ref="#ob_pinchbug" data-rendition="inScene" data-was="rs">pinchbug</span>,” he called it.</span> It was in a <span data-type="obRef" data-ref="#ob_cap_box" data-was="rs">percussion-cap box</span>. The first thing the beetle did was to take him by the finger. A natural fillip followed, the beetle went floundering into the aisle and lit on its back, and the hurt finger went into the boy’s mouth. The beetle lay there working its helpless legs, unable to turn over. Tom eyed it, and longed for it; but it was safe out of his reach. Other people uninterested in the sermon found relief in the beetle, and they eyed it too. Presently a vagrant <span data-type="obRef" data-subdata-type="fauna" data-ref="#ob_poodle_dog" data-rendition="inScene" data-was="rs">poodle dog</span> came idling along, sad at heart, lazy with the summer softness and the quiet, weary of <span id="pb-939B868A-FAE4-4DF7-9227-2F2BB94E69D6" data-n="58" data-facs="media/pages/p58.jpg" data-was="pb"/>captivity, sighing for change. He spied the beetle; the drooping tail lifted and wagged. He surveyed the prize; walked around it; smelt at it from a safe distance; walked around it again; grew bolder, and took a closer smell; then lifted his lip and made a gingerly snatch at it, just missing it; made another, and another; began to enjoy the diversion; subsided to his stomach with the beetle between his paws, and continued his experiments; grew weary at last, and then indifferent and absent-minded. His head nodded, and little by little his chin descended and touched the enemy, who seized it. <span data-type="comment" data-was="note">excellent scene for illustrations/games/design</span> There was a sharp yelp, a flirt of the poodle’s head, and the beetle fell a couple of yards away, and lit on its back once more. The neighboring spectators shook with a gentle inward joy, several faces went behind fans and handkerchiefs, and Tom was entirely happy. The dog looked foolish, and probably felt so; but there was resentment in his heart, too, and a craving for revenge. So he went to the beetle and began a wary attack on it again; jumping at it from every point of a circle, lighting with his fore-paws within <span data-quantity="1" data-unit="in" data-was="measure">an inch</span> of the creature, making even closer snatches at it with his teeth, and jerking his head till his ears flapped again. But he grew tired once more, after a while; tried to amuse himself with a fly but found no relief; followed an ant around, with his nose close to the floor, and quickly wearied of that; yawned, sighed, forgot the beetle entirely, and sat down on it. Then there was a wild yelp of agony and the poodle went sailing up the aisle; the yelps continued, and so did the dog; he crossed the house in front of the altar; he flew down the other aisle; he crossed before the doors; he clamored up the home-stretch; his anguish grew with his progress, till <span id="pb-61699EB4-266D-4C57-BACE-EBEB3FE18EAC" data-n="59" data-facs="media/pages/p59.jpg" data-was="pb"/>presently he was but a woolly comet moving in its orbit with the gleam and the speed of light. At last the frantic sufferer sheered from its course, and sprang into its master’s lap; he flung it out of the window, was the window blue? and the voice of distress quickly thinned away and died in the distance.</p>

One of his upper front teeth was loose. This was lucky; he was about to begin to groan, as a “starter,” as he called it, when it occurred to him that if he came into court with that argument, his aunt would pull it out, and that would hurt. So he thought he would hold the tooth in reserve for the present, and seek further.</span>
            <span data-ana="#myth" data-was="seg">Nothing offered for some little time, and then he remembered hearing the <span data-type="persRef" data-ref="#c_doctor" data-rendition="notInScene" data-was="rs">doctor</span> tell about a certain thing that laid up a patient for two or three weeks and threatened to make him lose a finger.</span> So the boy eagerly drew his sore toe from under the sheet and held it up for inspection.

So at last, with a sigh and a yawn, he gave it up. It seemed to him that the noon recess would never come. The air was utterly dead. There was not a breath stirring. It was the sleepiest of sleepy days. The drowsing murmur of the five and twenty studying scholars soothed the soul like the spell that is in the murmur of bees.  <span id="th_291" data-type="#mark_twain" data-was="seg">Away off in the flaming sunshine, Cardiff Hill lifted its soft green sides through a shimmering veil of heat, tinted with the purple of distance; a few birds floated on lazy wing high in the air; no other living thing was visible but some cows, and they were asleep.</span>  Tom’s heart ached to be free, or else to have something of interest <span id="pb-1819A908-92AD-4BC7-998E-FBB604F8EDDF" data-n="73" data-facs="media/pages/p73.jpg" data-was="pb"/>to do to pass the dreary time. His hand wandered into his pocket and his face lit up with a glow of gratitude that was prayer, though he did not know it. Then furtively the <span data-type="obRef" data-ref="#ob_cap_box" data-was="rs">percussion-cap box</span> came out. He released the <span data-type="obRef" data-ref="#ob_tick" data-rendition="inScene" data-was="rs">tick</span> and put him on the long flat desk. The creature probably glowed with a gratitude that amounted to prayer, too, at this moment, but it was premature: for when he started thankfully to travel off, Tom turned him aside with a pin and made him take a new direction.  </p>

At last luck seemed to settle and abide with Joe. The tick tried this, that, and the other course, and got as excited and as anxious as the boys themselves, but time and again just as he would have victory in his very grasp, so to speak, and Tom’s fingers would be twitching to begin, Joe’s pin would deftly head him off, and keep possession.

It seemed to him that life was but a trouble, at best, and he more than half envied Jimmy Hodges, so lately released; <span id="th_361" data-type="#ethics" data-was="seg">it must be very peaceful, he thought, to lie and slumber and dream forever and ever, with the wind whispering through the trees and caressing the grass and the flowers over the grave, and nothing to bother and grieve about, ever any more. </span>If he only had a clean Sunday-school record he could be willing to go, and be done with it all.

And at the zenith of his fame, how he would suddenly appear at the old village and stalk into church, brown and weather-beaten, in his black velvet doublet and trunks, his great jack-boots, his crimson sash, his belt bristling with horse-pistols, his crime-rusted cutlass at his side, his slouch hat with waving plumes, his black flag unfurled, with the skull and crossbones on it, and hear with swelling ecstasy the whisperings, “It’s Tom Sawyer the Pirate! — the Black Avenger of the Spanish Main!”</span>

He would have tossed and fidgeted, as his nerves demanded, but he was afraid he might wake Sid. So he lay still, and stared up into the dark. Everything was dismally still. By and by, out of the stillness, little, scarcely preceptible noises began to emphasize themselves. The ticking of the clock began to bring itself into notice. Old beams began to crack mysteriously. The stairs creaked faintly. Evidently spirits were abroad. A measured, muffled snore issued from Aunt Polly’s chamber. And now the <span id="pb-5D4E63AC-25D9-4475-9399-D2D06A82FB15" data-n="86" data-facs="media/pages/p86.jpg" data-was="pb"/>tiresome chirping of a cricket that no human ingenuity could locate, began. <span id="th_417" data-type="#superstition" data-was="seg">Next the ghastly ticking of a death-watch in the wall at the bed’s head made Tom shudder — it meant that somebody’s days were numbered.</span> Then the howl of a far-off dog rose on the night air, and was answered by a fainter howl from a remoter distance. Tom was in an agony. At last he was satisfied that time had ceased and eternity begun; he began to doze, in spite of himself; the clock chimed eleven, but he did not hear it. And then there came, mingling with his half-formed dreams, a most melancholy caterwauling. The raising of a neighboring window disturbed him. A cry of “Scat! you devil!” and the crash of an empty bottle against the back of his aunt’s woodshed brought him wide awake, and a single minute later he was dressed and out of the window and creeping along the roof of the “ell” on all fours. He “meow’d” with caution once or twice, as he went; then jumped to the roof of the woodshed and thence to the ground.  <span data-type="persRef" data-ref="#c_huck" data-rendition="inScene" data-was="rs">Huckleberry Finn</span> was there, with his dead cat.

It had a crazy board fence around it, which leaned inward in places, and outward the rest of the time, but stood upright nowhere. Grass and weeds grew rank over the whole cemetery. All the old graves were sunken in, there was not a tombstone on the place; round-topped, worm-eaten boards staggered over the graves, leaning for support and finding none. “Sacred to the memory of” So-and-So had been painted on them once, but it

They tiptoed out, through the broken weather-boarding, and stopped at a little distance to exchange a parting word. <span id="th_493" data-type="#superstition" data-was="seg">That long, lugubrious howl rose on the night air again!

Why had he not been called — persecuted till he was up, as usual? The thought filled him with bodings. Within five minutes he was dressed and down-stairs, feeling sore and drowsy. The family were still at table, but they had finished breakfast. There was no voice of rebuke; but there were averted eyes; there was a silence and an air of solemnity that struck a chill to the culprit’s heart. He sat down and tried to seem gay, but it was up-hill work; it roused no smile, no response, and he lapsed into silence and let his heart sink down to the depths.</p>
                    <p id="ts-AF8AF1AC-39EE-457F-B28B-CF24F1712EA4">After breakfast his aunt took him aside, and Tom almost brightened in the hope that he was going to be flogged; but it was not so.  <span id="th_500" data-type="#ethics" data-was="seg">His aunt wept over him and asked him how he could go and break her old heart so; and finally told him to go on, and ruin himself and bring her gray hairs with sorrow to the grave, for it was no use for her to try any more. This was worse than a thousand whippings, and Tom’s heart was sorer now than his body. He cried, he pleaded for forgiveness, promised to reform over and over again, and then received his dismissal, feeling that he had won but an imperfect forgiveness and established but a feeble confidence.</span>

Tom had struggled with his pride <span data-was="date">a few days</span>, and tried to “ <span data-type="#idiom" data-was="quote">whistle her down the wind</span>,” but failed. <span id="th_527" data-type="#childhood" data-n="suffering for love outgrows all other Tom’s interests and habits " data-was="seg">He began to find himself hanging around her father’s house, nights, and feeling very miserable. She was ill. What if she should die! There was distraction in the thought. He no longer took an interest in war, nor even in piracy. The charm of life was gone; there was nothing but dreariness left. He put his hoop away, and his bat; there was nojoy in them any more.</span>
            <span data-type="persRef" data-ref="#c_polly" data-rendition="inScene" data-was="rs">His aunt</span> was concerned. She began to try all manner of remedies <span id="pb-8770A927-0562-4702-ABDF-4668DE964200" data-n="108" data-facs="media/pages/p108.jpg" data-was="pb"/>on him. She was one of those people who are infatuated with patent medicines and all new-fangled methods of producing health or mending it. <span id="th_528" data-type="#community" data-was="seg">She was an inveterate experimenter in these things. When something fresh in this line came out she was in a fever, right away, to try it; not on herself, for she was never ailing, but on anybody else that came handy. She was a subscriber for all the “Health” periodicals and phrenological frauds; and the solemn ignorance they were inflated with was breath to her nostrils. All the “rot” they contained about ventilation, and how to go to bed, and how to get up, and what to eat, and what to drink, and how much exercise to take, and what frame of mind to keep one’s self in, and what sort of clothing to wear, was all gospel to her, and she never observed that her health-journals of the current month customarily upset everything they <span data-type="comment" data-was="note">interesting cultural comment concerning the culture around the health industry and its marketing at this era</span>had recommended the month before. She was as <span data-type="persTrait" data-ref="#c_polly" data-corresp="#c_mark_twain" data-was="rs">simple-hearted</span> and <span data-type="persTrait" data-ref="#c_polly" data-corresp="#c_mark_twain" data-was="rs">honest</span> as the day was long, and so she was <span data-type="persTrait" data-ref="#c_polly" data-corresp="#c_mark_twain" data-was="rs">an easy victim</span>. She gathered together her quack periodicals and her quack medicines, and thus armed with death, went about on her pale horse, metaphorically speaking, with “hell following after.”</span> But she never suspected that she was not an angel of healing and the balm of Gilead in disguise, to the suffering neighbors.</p>

Then at once they reached and hovered upon the imminent verge of sleep — but an intruder came, now, that would not “down.” It was conscience. </span>They began to feel a vague fear that they had been doing wrong to run away; and next they thought of the stolen meat, and then the real torture came. They tried to argue it away by reminding conscience that they had purloined sweetmeats and apples scores of times; but conscience was not to be appeased by such thin plausibilities; it seemed to them, in the end, that there was no getting around the stubborn fact that taking sweetmeats was only “hooking,” while taking bacon and hams and such valuables was plain simple stealing — and there was a command against that in the Bible. So they inwardly resolved that so long as they remained in the business, their piracies should not again be sullied with the crime of stealing. Then conscience granted a truce, and these curiously inconsistent pirates fell peacefully to sleep.</span>

They discovered that the island was about three miles long and a quarter of a mile wide, and that the shore it lay closest to was only separated from it by a narrow channel hardly two hundred yards wide. They took a swim about every hour, so it was close upon the middle of the afternoon when they got back to camp.

He put his hand on his jacket pocket, found his piece of <span data-type="obRef" data-ref="#ob_sycamorebark" data-rendition="inScene" data-was="rs">bark</span> safe, and then struck through the woods, following the shore, with streaming garments.</span> Shortly <span id="pb-CF403DB4-6167-48AC-A6B6-52FDB94594DB" data-n="129" data-facs="media/pages/p129.jpg" data-was="pb"/>
            <span data-was="time">before ten o’clock</span> he came out into an open place opposite the village, and saw the ferryboat lying in the shadow of the trees and the high bank.

Tom felt happy in his success, for he knew it was the boat’s last trip for the night. At the end of a long twelve or fifteen minutes the wheels stopped, andTom slipped overboard and swam ashore in the dusk, landing fifty yards downstream, out of danger of possible stragglers.</p>

He untied the skiff at the stern, slipped into it, and was soon rowing cautiously upstream. When he had pulled a mile above the village, he started quartering across and bent himself stoutly to his work.

                        <span data-type="persRef" data-ref="#c_joe_harper" data-rendition="inScene" data-was="rs">Joe</span> awoke, and called

There was a brooding oppressiveness in the air that seemed to bode something. The boys huddled themselves together and sought the friendly companionship of the fire, though the dull dead heat of the breathless atmosphere was stifling. They sat still, intent and waiting. The solemn hush continued. Beyond the light of the fire everything was swallowed up in the blackness of darkness. Presently there came a quivering glow that vaguely revealed the foliage for a moment and then vanished. By and by another came, a little stronger. Then another.
                        <span id="th_616" data-type="#superstition" data-was="seg">Then a faint moan came sighing through the branches of the forest and the boys felt a fleeting breath upon their cheeks, and shuddered with the fancy that the Spirit of the Night had gone by.</span> There was a pause. Now a weird flash turned night into day and showed every little grass-blade, separate and distinct, that grew about their feet. And it showed three white, startled faces, too. A deep peal of thunder went rolling and tumbling down the heavens and lost itself in sullen rumblings in the distance. A sweep of chilly air passed by, rustling all the leaves and snowing the flaky ashes broadcast about the fire. Another fierce glare lit up the forest and an instant crash followed that seemed to rend the tree-tops right over the boys’ heads. They clung together in terror, in the thick gloom that followed. A few big rain-drops fell pattering upon the leaves.</p>
                    <p id="ts-B4EE62D2-D013-4AFC-831E-22F923662170">“

                    <p id="ts-718BD9D0-72A4-4EB4-9BBD-3F94DDEECDF6">They sprang away, stumbling over roots and among
                        <span data-type="oRef" data-ref="#ob_flora" data-rendition="inScene" data-was="rs">vines</span> in the dark, no two plunging in the same direction. A furious blast roared through the trees, making everything sing as it went. One blinding flash after another came, and peal on peal of deafening thunder. And now a drenching rain poured down and the rising hurricane drove it in sheets along the ground. The boys cried out to each
                        <span id="pb-4BE28EBA-BBA4-464B-9B78-554275EE6972" data-n="141" data-facs="media/pages/p141.jpg" data-was="pb" />other, but the roaring wind and the booming thunder-blasts drowned their voices utterly. However, one by one they straggled in at last and took shelter under the
                        <span data-type="obRef" data-ref="#ob_tent" data-rendition="inScene" data-was="rs">tent</span>, cold, scared, and streaming with water; but to have company in misery seemed something to be grateful for. They could not talk,
                        <span data-type="obTrait" data-ref="#ob_tent" data-was="rs">the old sail</span> flapped so furiously, even if the other noises would have allowed them. The tempest rose higher and higher, and presently
                        <span data-type="obRef" data-ref="#ob_tent" data-rendition="inScene" data-was="rs">the sail</span> tore loose from its fastenings and went winging away on the blast. The boys seized each others' hands and fled, with many tumblings and bruises, to the shelter of a great oak that stood upon the river-bank. Now the battle was at its highest. Under the ceaseless conflagration of lightning that flamed in the skies, everything below stood out in clean-cut and shadowless distinctness: the bending trees, the billowy river, white with foam, the driving spray of spume-flakes, the dim outlines of the high bluffs on the other side, glimpsed through the drifting cloud-rack and the slanting veil of rain.Every little while some giant tree yielded the fight and fell crashing through the younger growth; and the unflagging thunder-peals came now in ear-splitting explosive bursts, keen and sharp, and unspeakably
                        <span id="pb-028E98DF-832F-4DD5-8E53-CE169E406EE6" data-n="142" data-facs="media/pages/p142.jpg" data-was="pb" />appalling. The storm culminated in one matchless effort that seemed likely to tear the island to pieces, burn it up, drown it to the tree-tops, blow it away, and deafen every creature in it, all at one and the same moment. It was a wild night for homeless young heads to be out in.</p>

The boys went back to camp, a good deal awed; but they found there was still something to be thankful for, because the great sycamore, the shelter of their beds, was a ruin, now, blasted by the lightnings, and they were not under it when the catastrophe happened.</p>

They were eloquent in their distress; but they presently discovered that the fire had eaten so far up under the great log it had been built against (where it curved upward and separated itself from the ground), that a handbreadth or so of it had escaped wetting; so they patiently wrought until, with shreds and bark gathered from the under sides of sheltered logs, they coaxed the fire to burn again. Then they piled on great dead boughs till they had a roaring furnace, and were glad-hearted once more. They dried their <span data-type="obRef" data-subdata-type="food" data-ref="#ob_boiled_ham" data-rendition="inScene" data-was="rs">boiled ham</span> and had a feast, and after that they sat by the fire and expanded and glorified their midnight adventure until morning, for there was not a dry spot to sleep on, anywhere around. </p>

Tom pretended not to see her. He moved away and joined a group of boys and girls and began to talk.

It gratified all the vicious vanity that was in him; and so, instead of winning him, it only “set him up” the more and made him the more diligent to avoid betraying that he knew she was about. Presently she gave over skylarking, and moved irresolutely about, sighing once or twice and glancing furtively and wistfully toward Tom.

And he kept drifting about to find Becky and lacerate her with the performance. At last he spied her, but there was a sudden falling of his mercury. She was sitting cosily on a little bench behind the schoolhouse looking at <span data-type="obRef" data-ref="#ob_beckys_book #c_becky" data-rendition="inScene" data-was="rs">a picture-book</span> with <span data-type="persRef" data-ref="#c_alfred_temple" data-rendition="inScene" data-was="rs">Alfred Temple </span>— and so absorbed were they, and their heads so close together over the book, that they did not seem to be conscious of anything in the world besides. <span id="th_665" data-type="#ethics" data-was="seg">Jealousy ran red-hot through Tom’s veins. He began to hate himself for throwing away the chance Becky had offered for a reconciliation. He called himself a fool, and all the hard names he could think of. He wanted to cry with vexation.</span> Amy chatted happily along, as they walked, for her heart was singing, but Tom’s tongue had lost its function. He did not hear what Amy was saying, and whenever she paused expectantly he could only stammer an awkward assent, which was as often misplaced as otherwise. He kept drifting to the rear of the school-house, again and again, to sear his eyeballs with the hateful spectacle there. He could not help it. And it maddened him to see, as he thought he saw, that Becky Thatcher never once suspected that he was even in the land of the living. But she did see, nevertheless; <span id="th_666" data-type="#ethics" data-was="seg">and she knew she was winning her fight, too, and was glad to see him suffer as she had suffered.</span>

Presently the <span data-type="obRef" data-ref="#ob_spelling_book #c_tom" data-rendition="inScene" data-was="rs">spelling-book</span> discovery was made, and Tom’s mind was entirely full of his own matters for a while after that. Becky roused up from her lethargy of distress and showed good interest in the proceedings. She did not expect that Tom could get out of his trouble by denying that he spilt the ink on the book himself; and she was right. The denial only seemed to make the thing worse for Tom.

By and by, Mr. Dobbins straightened himself up, yawned, then unlocked his desk, and reached for his book, but seemed undecided whether to take it out or leave it. Most of the pupils glanced up languidly, but there were two among them that watched his movements with intent eyes. Mr. Dobbins fingered his book absently for a while, then took it out and settled himself in his chair to read! Tom shot a glance at Becky.

If Tom only had the wasted opportunity back again! Too late. There was no help for Becky now, he said.

The themes were the same that had been illuminated upon similar occasions by their mothers before them, their grandmothers, and doubtless all their ancestors in the female line clear back to the Crusades. “Friendship” was one; “Memories of Other Days”; “Religion in History”; “Dream Land”; “The Advantages of Culture”; “Forms of Political Government Compared and <span id="pb-9F3EAD45-9300-4706-87B7-25BF3BD945E3" data-n="171" data-facs="media/pages/p171.jpg" data-was="pb"/>Contrasted”; “Melancholy”; “Filial Love”; “Heart Longings,” etc., etc.</span>

No matter what the subject might be, a brain-racking effort was made to squirm it into some aspect or other that the moral and religious mind could contemplate with edification. The glaring insincerity of these sermons was not sufficient to compass the banishment of the fashion from the schools, and it is not sufficient to-day; it never will be sufficient while the world stands, perhaps. <span id="th_719" data-type="#gender" data-was="seg">There is no school in all our land where the young ladies do not feel obliged to close their compositions with a sermon; and you will find that the sermon of the most frivolous and the least religious girl in the school is always the longest and the most relentlessly pious.</span> But enough of this.

He never had supposed for a moment that so large a sum as a hundred dollars was to be found in actual money in any one’s possession.

This uncertainty must be swept away. He would snatch a hurried breakfast and go and find Huck. Huck was sitting on the gunwale of a flatboat, listlessly dangling his feet in the water and looking very melancholy. Tom concluded to let Huck lead up to the subject. If he did not do it, then the adventure would be proved to have been only a dream.</p>

So it was decided to say nothing anybody about the night’s programme. Presently it occurred to Tom that maybe Huck might come this very night and give the signal. The thought took a deal of the spirit out of his anticipations. Still he could not bear to give up the fun at Widow Douglas'.

But all things have an end. By-and-by the procession went filing down the steep descent of the main avenue, the flickering rank of lights dimly revealing the lofty walls of rock almost to their point of junction sixty feet overhead. This main avenue was not more than eight or ten feet wide. Every few steps other lofty and still narrower crevices branched from it on either hand <span id="pb-8987AF7A-047A-465F-B57A-EAF764E15B5E" data-n="220" data-facs="media/pages/p220.jpg" data-was="pb"/>— for McDougal’s cave was but a vast labyrinth of crooked aisles that ran into each other and out again and led nowhere. <span id="th_899" data-type="#myth" data-was="seg">It was said that one might wander days and nights together through its intricate tangle of rifts and chasms, and never find the end of the cave; and that he might go down, and down, and still down, into the earth, and it was just the same — labyrinth under labyrinth, and no end to any of them. <span data-type="placeTrait" data-ref="#pl_cave" data-was="rs">No man “knew” the cave.</span> That was an impossible thing.

They went straight ahead, then, until they came to the path that led up Cardiff Hill; this they took. They passed by the old Welshman’s house, half-way up the hill, without hesitating, and still climbed upward. Good, thought Huck, they will bury it in the old quarry. But they never stopped at the quarry. They passed on, up the summit. They plunged into the narrow path between the tall sumach bushes, and were at once hidden in the gloom. Huck closed up and shortened his distance, now, for they would never be able to see him. He trotted along awhile; then slackened his pace, fearing he was gaining too fast; moved on a piece, then stopped altogether; listened; no sound; none, save that he seemed to hear the beating of his own heart.

The children stood still and listened; but there was no result. Tom turned upon the back track at once, and hurried his steps. It was but a little while before a certain indecision in his manner revealed another fearful fact to Becky — he could not find his way back!</p>

He sat looking into her drawn face and saw it grow smooth and natural under the influence of pleasant dreams; and by-and-by a smile dawned and rested there. The peaceful face reflected somewhat of peace and healing into his own spirit, and his thoughts wandered away to bygone times and dreamy memories. While he was deep in his musings, Becky woke up with a breezy little laugh — but it was stricken dead upon her lips, and a groan followed it.</p>

It might be three feet deep, it might be a hundred — there was no passing it at any rate. Tom got down on his breast and reached as far down as he could. No bottom. They must stay there and wait until the searchers came. They listened; evidently the distant shoutings were growing more distant! a moment or two more and they had gone altogether. The heart-sinking misery of it! Tom whooped until he was hoarse, but it was of no use. He talked hopefully to Becky; but an age of anxious waiting passed and no sounds came again.</p>
